Decommissioning is defined as subjecting the bulk fuel infrastructure asset to an engineering process that leaves it in a safe state without the need for further maintenance. The specific steps to decommission a bulk fuel installation would need to be determined as part of the specific asset project activity (JSP 317 Part 1, Chapter 5, Paragraph 19). It would require authorization from the relevant TLB and involve comprehensive planning and execution processes to ensure factors such as operational requirements, health, safety and environmental impacts, financial cost, security and risk are considered. The detailed project plan and Management of Change (MoC) procedure should be completed within a 12-month period from the TLB’s initial decision on the operational requirement of the asset. Once decommissioned, the asset will ultimately require full demolition at some point. (JSP 317 Part 1, page 63, paragraph b, point c)

According to the JSP 342 Part 1.pdf (pages 15 and 18), your child is entitled to a place in a MOD school during your assignment, provided that you continue to serve or be employed on the overseas Command or retain official dependant status in the overseas command. If you prefer, you may also seek admission to a host nation school, but responsibility for all educational expenses, including transport to/from the host nation school, lies with the parent/carer and may not be reclaimed (page 15).

However, if you choose to home educate your child overseas, you will need to inform your local Command/Commander/Head of Establishment of your intent, take on full responsibility for all costs of education including transport, additional educational support and/or reasonable adjustments, and provide notice to your school so that your child can be removed from the admissions register (page 21). You will also not be able to access MOD education resources during this period.

1. Thoroughly observe all areas and processes in the workplace, including waste storage and disposal systems (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 12).
2. Identify problems and opportunities by considering ways to minimize emission, release, and spread of hazardous substances through control measures such as ventilation systems, containment, or substituting materials (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 12).
3. If control measures are not practicable or adequate control cannot be achieved by other means, use PPE or RPE for maintenance operations where the risk of exposure must be assessed (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 16).
4. Fully identify the activity or process and all substances or products being used or produced; consider who and how many are likely to be exposed, how, and for how long (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 14).
5. Record significant findings, and use templates such as MOD Form 5011 for the assessment summary and Control Guidance Sheets for additional information (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 16 & 6).
6. Ensure that all control measures identified by the COSHH assessment are implemented, communicated, monitored, and reviewed (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 8).
7. Consult with specialists or relevant organizations when required for advice or training (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 16 & 23).

Additionally, comply with COSHH Regulations by assessing risks, providing adequate control measures, ensuring the use and maintenance of these, and offering information, instruction, and training when necessary (JSP 375 Part 2, p. 45-46). Ensure that Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available for all activities involving hazardous substances and provide them to the MOD Hazardous Stores Information System (HSIS) (JSP 375 Part 2, p. 46).

In case of working with or exposure to Cr(VI), undertake a suitable risk assessment in accordance with the chapter's guidelines, mandating compliance with COSHH and REACH Regulations (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 34). Perform an assessment of health risks arising from handling Cr(VI) containing substances or activities where Cr(VI) may be present, and implement prevention measures such as substitution with less hazardous alternatives if possible (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, p. 30-31).

0,,,,,,,Under what circumstances do I need to conduct health surveillance and monitoring as a line manager?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 4 (Policy Statement 1), a line manager must ensure that no activity is conducted which is liable to expose themselves or any person to any substance hazardous to health unless a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risk is conducted, and control measures are implemented. If the risk assessment identifies the need for Health Surveillance (HS) or Health Monitoring (HM), it is the manager's responsibility to make sure that suitable and appropriate HS/HM programmes are developed and implemented for new and existing staff (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 9, Policy Statement 6). This applies to all workplaces on the Defence estate, including shared facilities and lodger units (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 9, Policy Statement 35). The commander or line manager must also make sure that personnel have access to all relevant resources/equipment and information regarding procedures and arrangements for dealing with emergencies (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 5, Policy Statement 8).

There is a legal obligation to undertake HS but not HM, however, HM is highly beneficial as it helps identify health issues within the workplace and monitor trends (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 9, Policy Statement 37). If personnel are exposed to hazardous substances where there could be serious risks to health if control measures failed or deteriorated, exposure limits might be exceeded, control measures might not be working properly, or there is a disease associated with the substance in use (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 9, Policy Statement 6), then HS and HM must be implemented.

Therefore, as a line manager, you need to conduct health surveillance and monitoring when:

* A risk assessment identifies the need for HS or HM.
* Personnel are exposed to hazardous substances where there could be serious risks to health if control measures failed or deteriorated.
* Exposure limits might be exceeded.
* Control measures might not be working properly.
* There is a disease associated with the substance in use.

The two methods for undertaking fit testing are qualitative fit testing (QLFT) and quantitative fit testing (QNFT). QLFT relies on the wearer's senses to detect if there is a gap in the seal between the RPE and their face, while QNFT uses specialist instrumentation to measure and calculate leakage at the seal. Full face RPE must be tested using QNFT, and half masks and FFPs can also be tested using either method. (Annex A, pages 13)

Therefore, to test the fit of respiratory protective equipment, you should follow the procedures for qualitative or quantitative fit testing as described in JSP 375 Vol 1 Chapter 15. The specific kit and instructions for each method can be obtained from MOD Stores using the provided NSN numbers.

QLFT is suitable for testing half masks and FFPs (commonly referred to as disposable masks) kits available through MOD Stores on NATO stock numbers: (1) QLFT Kit (Sweet) – NSN 4240012488146; (2) QLFT Kit (Bitter) – NSN 4240993711434. b. Quantitative fit testing (QNFT) uses specialist instrumentation to measure and calculate the leakage at the seal between the RPE and the wearers face. Full face RPE has to be tested using QNFT. Half masks and FFPs can also be tested using this method. 6""  '

0,,,,,,,What safety considerations do I need to make when building a trench?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 11.pdf, page 4, safety considerations for building a trench include ensuring the tube is laid straight and level with a tolerance of plus or minus 50 mm over a 100 m length, grounding off and feathering out any edges or lips that may cause backsplash, inserting a flexible continuous liner to avoid problems with settlement, supporting the tube to eliminate subsequent settlement causing backsplash hazards from misaligned joints, having the socket end of the pipe facing the firer, sealing all joints watertight and coating the tube with a waterproof membrane (for tubes without a liner), and revetting the trenches with timber or pre-formed concrete sections with a 225 mm timber surround at the top to prevent ricochet. Additionally, if there is a potential hazard such as animals or children accessing the range when not in use, lids to cover the trench when it is not in use should be considered (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15, page 10).

Furthermore, JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 33.pdf emphasizes the importance of remaining vigilant for buried or hidden services and undertaking repeat checks using locating devices during excavation work (page 5). The passage also mentions that even very shallow excavations may expose personnel to considerable risk, as well as potential hazards from adjacent structures and hazards likely to cause fire (page 4).

Therefore, the safety considerations for building a trench include ensuring the structural integrity of the trench itself, as well as identifying and mitigating potential hazards from buried services and adjacent structures.

If asbestos is identified or suspected, appropriate control measures must be implemented to reduce the exposure risk to a level that is ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable). These controls may include providing and using appropriate PPE and RPE, conducting regular workplace inspections, making sure that information about the presence of asbestos is recorded and communicated to new users, and obtaining information on the potential presence of asbestos from previous reports or surveys. Additionally, personnel should be trained in manual handling and heavy items should be stored at a convenient height to suit the user. (Citations: pages 15, 17, 20, and 22)

If asbestos is confirmed to be present, precautions include carefully removing clothing and sealing it in an approved container or plastic bag, showering thoroughly, reporting the incident to your manager and the Accountable Person (AP), confirming if asbestos is present by checking the Asbestos Register or arranging for a sample of the material to be analyzed, notifying HSE if a license is required, and recording remedial work and/or removals in the Asbestos Register.

The Event Organiser should form an event planning committee with key stakeholders and competent persons representing key risk areas (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 37, page 2). A hazard analysis and risk assessments should be conducted, giving due consideration to third-party protection including vulnerable groups (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 37, page 2). Control measures required to mitigate the risks should be identified in the risk assessments and form the basis of the event safety management plan.

The Event Organiser should ensure close liaison and strong communication exists throughout all phases of the event (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 37, page 3). All Defence personnel and interested parties involved with the event should be informed of their precise roles and responsibilities, including emergency procedures (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 37, page 3). Adjacent or adjoining public venues, local residents, and businesses should be kept informed of how the event may affect their normal day-to-day activities (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 37, page 3).

For individuals with disabilities or medical conditions that may affect their response to an emergency, a risk assessment should be conducted, and a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) produced (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 1, page 3). The PEEP should take into consideration all areas where the individual can be reasonably expected to visit within the establishment.

For military establishments with dangerous forces such as nuclear electrical generating stations, parties to the conflict are obligated to avoid locating any military objectives in their vicinity (JSP 383, page 133). Practical precautions should be taken to avoid the release of dangerous forces, and compliance may be achieved by using precision-guided munitions or other precision bombing techniques.

Additionally, approval must be granted for dogs to be brought onto the Defence estate, with suitable facilities and arrangements for the disposal of animal faecal matter and other waste put in place before approval is granted (paragraph 8). The local policy decision to allow dogs on the Defence estate rests with the CO / HoE, who must develop and promulgate a local policy and rules defining areas where dogs are allowed or prohibited, rules and responsibilities for the dog's owner or handler, procedures for approval and rejection of applications to bring a dog onto the Defence estate, rescinding privilege to bring or keep a dog on the Defence estate, assessing and monitoring approved dogs, and recording approved dogs on a Unit / Establishment Register (paragraph 7). It is also important to note that German legislation contains special requirements for dogs in the Federal Republic of Germany, and occupants should enquire about local laws prior to moving (JSP 464 Vol 1 Part 1.pdf, page 91).

There are also disciplinary offenses related to animal cruelty in the Armed Forces Act 2006 (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 14.pdf, page 31). The punishment for such offenses can range from restriction of privileges and/or stoppage of leave to detention or reduction in rank depending on the aggravating factors involved.

Therefore, the rules about dogs in military camps include proper inoculation, control or restraint, approval for bringing them onto the Defence estate with suitable facilities for waste disposal, and adherence to local policies and procedures. Failure to follow these rules or engaging in cruel behavior towards animals can result in disciplinary action.

1. Keep It Clean: Avoid dirty clothing as it compromises insulation (Annex B, p. 2).
2. Adjust Layers: Avoid overheating and sweating by adjusting layers to maintain a comfortable body temperature (Annex B, p. 2).
3. Wear It Loose: Loose, layered clothing traps air and provides good insulation (Annex B, p. 2).
4. Keep It Dry: Wet clothing leads to rapid heat loss; put on waterproofs before exposure to rain or snow and change into dry clothing as soon as possible if clothing next to the skin becomes wet (Annex B, p. 2 & 3).
5. Wear Suitable PPE: Enter cold water slowly to avoid cold shock and wear suitable PPE (Annex C, p. 6).
6. Maintain Clothing: Make sure kit is cared for in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions and replaced if function has deteriorated (Annex C, p. 6).
7. Provide Guidance: Recognize changes in weather and dynamically assess risk, modifying controls as necessary to reduce cold exposure and susceptibility to cold injury throughout the activity (Annex C, p. 6).
8. Plan for Wetness: Wear waterproof layers in anticipation of precipitation and avoid waiting until personnel are wet (Annex C, p. 6).
9. Avoid Cramped Posture: Note increased risk of cold injury, particularly lower limb, and ensure personnel are able to move as much as possible (Annex B, p. 3 & Annex A, p. 7).
10. Provide Shelter: Ensure shelter is available for periods when personnel are stationary (Annex A, p. 7).
11. Avoid Alcohol: Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before activity as it increases the risk of cold injury (Annex B, p. 3).
12. Education and Preparation: Ensure all personnel have been educated on cold injury, its signs and symptoms, and have access to guides (Annex A, p. 8).
13. Sufficient Water and Food Intake: Provide a sufficient amount of safe water and other drinks throughout the activity, as individuals may not feel thirsty in cold conditions and encourage drinking (Annex A, p. 8).
14. Proper Dressing and Equipment: Ensure personnel are provided with the correct clothing and sleeping system to reduce the risk of cold injury (Annex A, p. 8).

It is broken down into four elements: safe person, safe equipment, safe place, and safe practice (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 8.pdf, page 5). To implement an SSW, you should first conduct a risk assessment to identify the hazards associated with the work activity. Then, put in place control measures to eliminate those risks or reduce them to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 8.pdf, page 5). This may include providing appropriate training and instruction for personnel, ensuring that equipment is suitable and properly maintained, implementing safe work procedures, and securing the work area.

The safety case should also take into account activities beyond normal operation and training, manufacturing, testing, commissioning, transporting, storing, maintaining, and disposing of the equipment safely [16-18]. It is essential to identify critical safety controls, instrumentation, and systems required for safe operation and determine the proposed operating envelope for the equipment [5][15].

Additionally, the SRO or User is responsible for making sure that a safety case has been produced, and all relevant safety issues have been considered [14]. The need for a safety case depends on the complexity of the equipment and the level of risk involved [5]. Equipment design and safety cases should progressively inform how the equipment will be maintained and disposed of under current expectations and known safety risks [3].

They must also consider how equipment can be manufactured, tested, commissioned, transported, stored, maintained and disposed of safely. Stakeholder input will be required to validate assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other DLODs. Input from human factors specialists is also likely to be required to ensure these activities can be carried out safely and easily. Risk controls that cannot be put into practice easily are unlikely to be effective. 18.

A safety case is used to provide compelling evidence that equipment is safe for a given application in a given operating environment. A safety case must capture all the safety related risks associated with that equipment and evidence how these risks will be managed to as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level. 15.

In this case, General Yamashita was held responsible for failing to exercise effective control over his troops who were committing widespread atrocities in the Philippines. The International Military Tribunal laid down a test for command responsibility that considered a commander responsible if he had actual knowledge or should have known about war crimes being committed by his subordinates (JSP 383.pdf, page 492). This principle has been reflected in various legal texts and treaties, such as the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (JSP 383.pdf, page 493) and the Rome Statute (JSP 383.pdf, page 139).

1. The sand should be of a fine enough grade not to cause ricochet yet coarse enough to retain the required profile effectively without forming a surface crust (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 36).
2. The depth of sand is related to the type of weapon fired and should be raked regularly to prevent tunneling at the MPI behind targets and keep the surface in a loose state (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 36; JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15, p. 6).
3. Sand bullet catchers should be signed with which weapons are permitted (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 32, p. 1).
4. The sand profile must be maintained to the levels marked on the facility's side and back walls (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 32, p. 1).
5. Sand bullet catchers should be checked at least weekly for surface bullet debris removal and de-leading (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 36; JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 5, p. 10).
6. Additional safety features such as cladding or netting may be added to reduce danger if struck (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 3, p. 1; JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 37).
7. Salt may be added to retain moisture in the sand and prevent freezing in winter (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 37).
8. Mesh netting or geogrid may be used to reinforce the face angle of the sand bullet catcher (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 37).
9. Timber supports in the form of boxes or herringbone within the sand can assist the retention of the sand profile (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15, p. 6).

When large quantities of 7.62 mm rounds are fired or there are excessive quantities of jacket and bullet debris, balls of lead and other hazardous debris build up in the sand. The bullets tend to remain intact after impacting into the sand and can fuse together into a ball, which often occurs below the surface of the sand at the MPI behind the target after about 20,000 rounds have been fired in a lane. When subsequent bullets striking the ball no longer drive it deeper into the sand, backsplash and ricochet become hazards. So it is important that any such build-up of lead is removed before the hazards arise. (2) 5""  '

However, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has an exemption from clause 79(1)(g) of the EPA 90 for smoke and noise emitted from premises for operational and training activities that are prejudicial to health or a nuisance. This exemption is aimed solely at protecting activities directly related to national security (JSP 418 Leaflet 4-1, pages 1 and 2).

However, even with this exemption, an aggrieved person who suffers from noise or smoke nuisance from MOD premises can still bring a common law action against the MOD (JSP 418 Leaflet 4-1, page 2). It is important for the MOD to minimize potential nuisances generated by its activities and maintain good community relations to avoid unnecessary complaints and potential civil actions for nuisance (JSP 418 Leaflet 4, page 2).

Therefore, while the MOD has an exemption from certain statutory nuisance provisions under EPA 90, it is still expected to comply with relevant UK environmental legislation and implement management measures to minimize potential nuisances (JSP 418 Leaflet 4, page 2).

0,,,,,,,How do I manage the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, managing the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates involves several steps. First, adjusting for optimism bias should be a process rather than an event and assessed at each key stage in a project's approval process (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 105). Second, optimism bias should be considered for key parameters such as operating costs or benefits, and sensitivity analysis can be used to check switching values (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 105). Third, adjustment percentages for generic project categories can be used in the absence of more robust evidence (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 105). Fourth, risk management strategies should be adopted to manage optimism bias and its contributors (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, pages 109-110).

For example, in managing the capital expenditure estimate, a managed optimism bias contribution can be calculated by reducing the optimism bias percentage based on the degree of management of the contributing factors (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 109). The resultant capital expenditure optimism bias is then calculated by subtracting the managed optimism bias contribution from the upper bound optimism bias percentage and applying it to the initial estimate (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 109).

Similarly, for managing works duration estimates, the managed optimism bias contribution can be calculated, resulting in a works duration optimism bias that is then applied as an adjustment factor to the initial estimate (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 112).

Therefore, to manage the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates, it is recommended to assess and adjust for optimism bias at each key stage in a project's approval process, consider sensitivity analysis, use adjustment percentages for generic project categories when more robust evidence is not available, and adopt risk management strategies to effectively manage the contributing factors.

However, it does not mean that the 90% estimate is necessarily wrong. As long as both the original risk assessment and the optimism bias adjustment have been reviewed, and the outcome documented, the comparison of the optimism bias adjusted figure to the 90% cost estimate should not be viewed as a pass or fail test. It is not always sensible or required for the 90% cost estimate to exceed the more crudely estimated optimism bias adjusted cost.""  '

If there is no other evidence to support adjustments to operating costs or benefits, appraisers should use sensitivity analysis to check switching values. This should help to answer key questions such as: a. By how much can we allow benefits to fall short of expectations, if the proposal is to remain worthwhile? b. How likely is this? c. How much can operating costs increase, if the proposal is to remain worthwhile? d. How likely is this to happen? e. What will be the impact on benefits if operating costs are constrained?

The amount of the grant is determined by the scheme manager and can be found on the AF Pensions page. Additionally, JSP 534 Part 1.odt, page 0, states that the Resettlement Grant is payable if there are no other terminal benefits (JSP 534 Part 1.odt, page 0, paragraph regarding Resettlement Grant).

Once brought into permanent service, reservists attract many of the same rights and benefits as their Regular counterparts. In addition, their civilian employment rights are protected and both the employer and reservist may be entitled to claim financial assistance. 3. The Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14) amended RFA 96 to allow the Secretary of State (SofS) for Defence to authorise the mobilisation of Reserve Forces if it appears to the Secretary of State that it is necessary or desirable to use reservists for any purpose for which members of the Regular services may be used2.

0,,,,,,,How is financial compensation calculated for people made redundant from service?,"The financial compensation for people made redundant from service is calculated based on their final relevant earnings (FRE) and the length of their uncompleted service. The specific calculation depends on the person's rank, the terms of their service commitment, and when they left the service.

If a person was serving on a short term commitment and was made redundant, the Compensation Limitation Sum (CLS) is paid based on the lower of: (a) FRE/8 x completed service or (b) the sum of (1) FRE/8 x each year of uncompleted service and (2) FRE/8 (JSP 764 Part 5, page 16, para 0316).

If a person left service with insufficient service to qualify for an Immediate Pension or Early Discharge Payment (EDP), their CLS is calculated as follows: (a) FRE/8 x completed years or (b) (FRE/8 x uncompleted years) + FRE/8, depending on the length of their uncompleted service (JSP 764 Part 5, page 15, para 0211).

If a person left service after completing sufficient qualifying service to reach their Immediate Pension point but before age 60 or 65, they are entitled to an Immediate Pension or Preserved Pension, respectively (JSP 764 Part 5, page 15, para 0213).

If a person received Compensation for Loss of Office (CLO) and returned to service within the relevant period, they may be required to repay a relevant fraction of their CLS (JSP 764 Part 5, page 30, para 0507).

The amount of the CLS is to be determined by finding the lower of: (a) FRE/8 x completed service, or (b) the sum of (1) FRE/8 x each year of uncompleted service, and (2) FRE/8. where the terms: FRE - means final relevant earnings, and Uncompleted service - is defined at para 0205""  '

This is the person’s actual break in service, to be measured: • from the day following the last day of his previous paid service, • to the day immediately before the start date of the new paid service. 0506. Relevant Period. The length of the relevant period is to be calculated by applying the following formula: P x 365 days FRE or AP where: P is the amount of the lump sum paid on termination of service, and FRE is the person’s final relevant earnings (AFRS 06) used on termination of service for the purpose of calculating P, and AP is the person’s annual rate of basic pay (AFRS 2010) used on termination of service for the purpose of calculating P.

Each organisational SMS should relate back to this overarching policy document. 2. Responsibility for the management of health, safety, and environmental protection (HS&EP) is derived from the Secretary of State for Defence’s (SofS) Policy Statement.

OPCOM is the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units and to reassign forces, and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as necessary. It allows a commander to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned but does not include responsibility for administration or logistics (ADCON).

TACOM, on the other hand, is the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. It does not include the authority to issue orders covering every aspect of military operations and administration like OPCOM does, but it allows detailed local direction and control of movement or manoeuvre necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks (TACON).

Therefore, OPCOM is a broader command authority that includes the ability to assign missions and tasks, deploy units, and retain or delegate operational and tactical control, while TACOM is a more specific command authority focused on assigning tasks for the accomplishment of a mission","['This passage is from JSP 815 Vol 2 Annex A.pdf, page 5: ""b. Operational Control (OPCON). OPCON is the authority delegated to a commander to direct assigned forces so that they may accomplish their specific missions or tasks, usually limited by function, time, or location, to deploy units concerned and to retain or assign tactical control to those units. OPCON allows a commander to issue missions and tasks to subordinates, within the scope of the mission issued by higher authority4. It does not include the authority to assign separate employment of components of the units concerned. Nor does it include administrative or logistic control. c. Tactical Command (TACOM). TACOM is the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. d. Tactical Control (TACON).

In general, the command state should be set at the highest level possible, whereas control should be held at the lowest level possible. Control at too high a level can result in a loss of flexibility and tempo. Conversely, command at too low a level can result in the inability to concentrate resources and will hamper the ability to rapidly switch priorities. 1-40. Full Command (FULLCOM).

SpLD should not be treated as anything more than a naturally occurring difference to learning that, through targeted support and the implementation of coping strategies, can generally be successfully mitigated.

For a short-term absence of up to 3 days that has not affected operational effectiveness, a fine of more than 6 days’ pay or detention (up to 3 days) may be appropriate. For medium-term absences, detention is often preferred rather than a fine. Long-term absentees may face detention for up to 90 days with permission from Higher Authority. The severity of the punishment will depend on the facts of the case and whether the offender was aware that his/her ship or unit was under sailing orders, which resulted in another person being deployed in their place (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 14.pdf, page 8). In cases where the offender is under the influence of drugs or alcohol and may face dismissal, consideration should be given to referring the case to the DSP without giving the accused the option for trial by Court Martial (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 14.pdf, page 28).

Additionally, a person who has been captured by an enemy commits an offense if they intentionally and without lawful excuse serve with or assist the enemy in these same ways (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 7.pdf, page 6, Section 53).

Therefore, someone can be found guilty of 'assisting an enemy' under the circumstances outlined above, specifically when they intentionally and without lawful excuse engage in activities that benefit or support the enemy, such as communicating with them, providing them with information or supplies, harboring them, or serving with or assisting them in their military efforts.

Examples of dietary supplements include fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks, and protein shakes (JSP 835.pdf, page 40). It is important to note that dietary supplements should not be used to compensate for poor food choices or an inadequate diet, but rather as a supplement to ensure adequate nutrient intake when food choices are restricted due to operational constraints, travel, or other reasons (JSP 835.pdf, page 41).

Therefore, the answer to this question is that you can use dietary supplements that provide significant amounts of carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, or trace elements in a form that is readily used by the body. Examples include fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks, and protein shakes (JSP 835.pdf, page 40).

These drugs include anabolic agents such as anabolic steroids, pro-hormones, peptide hormones and growth factors such as Erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, corticotrophins, and growth hormone. It is therefore important to distinguish between dietary supplements and drugs. 3. Dietary Supplements.

Whilst the use of some supplements in certain circumstances can have positive effects, their misuse can have detrimental effects on the health of individuals and could lead to a positive Compulsory Drug Test (CDT) outcome. What are supplements? 2. The term supplement is used to describe a wide range of products ingested by individuals who desire a range of physiological and/or psychological effects from the provision of additional nutrients from the supplement.

Dietary supplements should not be used to compensate for poor food choices and an inadequate diet where a choice exists, but dietary supplements that provide additional energy and / or essential nutrients may be useful when food intake or food choices are restricted for reasons including operational constraints, travel, and periods when preparation and / or consumption of adequate meals is not possible or desirable.

The legal aid scheme is underpinned by the basic principle that those who can afford to pay some or all of their defence costs should do so, whereas those who cannot afford to contribute should receive legal aid support free of charge.

The basic amount is equal to 34% of the provisional annual amount of the person’s deferred pension under AFPS 15 at the point of exit (JSP 905 Part 1, page 142.3-142.4). The additional service allowance is equal to 0.85% of the provisional amount of the person’s deferred pension under AFPS 15 for every full year served as a member of the Regular forces beyond the 20-year service and age 40 qualification point (JSP 905 Part 1, page 143.1-143.3).

If an individual has left with a GPS pension, the pension will be calculated based on their final pensionable earnings and the enhanced amount of reckonable service they were allowed to count (JSP 764 Part 1, page 1124). The member’s final pensionable earnings are multiplied by the enhanced amount of reckonable service and then divided by 112 to determine the spouse, partner or civil partner pension (JSP 764 Part 1, page 1124).

1. Adopt a human-centered design approach involving end users in system and equipment design and evaluation (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 14, e).
2. Use established Human Factors principles, accepted best practices, and suitable methods, tools, techniques, and data (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 14, e).
3. Ensure that the Human Factors Integration (HFI) program aligns and integrates effectively with the project lifecycle (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 14, f).
4. Conduct various HFI activities throughout the development process:
   a. User Need Definition (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 14, a)
   b. System Requirements Definition (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 14, b)
   c. Assess Tenders and evaluate their Human Factors considerations (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 14, c).
5. Perform specific HFI activities such as:
   a. Allocation of Function between human and machine/autonomy (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 36, 5)
   b. Human Performance modeling and prediction (workload, human error, situation awareness) (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 36, 6)

These rules lay down how these M&S enablers are to be developed and assists decision makers at all levels in understanding the risk and impact of new, modified or enhanced M&S enablers. 3. This JSP Part 2 provides guidance in ensuring maximum ability to interoperate between simulation systems, and between simulation systems and real systems (such as C4I), to enable force elements to train as they operate""  '

The evaluation strategy is published in the Contract Notice in accordance with Regulations 30 and 31 of PCR and DSPCR. If the lowest price strategy is used, the contract will be awarded to the tender with the lowest price that is technically and commercially compliant. If MEAT is used, criteria other than price can be taken into account when awarding a contract. There are several MEAT evaluation strategies outlined in the Commercial Policy Statement on Tender Management or Tender Preparation and Management (JSP 507 Part 2, page 144 and 148). Pre-Contract Award Evaluation (PCAE) may also be used to mitigate risks associated with a specific tenderer or bid by evaluating their ability to meet draft contract requirements (JSP 940 Part 2, page 50).

It provides traceability of user requirements through to the eventual manufacture of equipment, development of software, or provision of a service (JSP 945 Part 1.pdf, page 6). The objective of configuration management is to define and manage the system's physical and functional characteristics by traceable specifications, datasheets, drawings, and related documentation (JSP 945 Part 1.pdf, page 6 and 1.2). Configuration management involves identifying components or assemblies referred to as Configuration Items (CIs) by their physical, functional, or performance characteristics (JSP 945 Part 1.pdf, page 8). The implementation of configuration management includes developing a strategy and documenting it in a Project Configuration Management Plan (PCMP), ensuring the configuration status is defined and traceable to user requirements at acceptance, and bringing the product under Ministry Control (JSP 945 Part 1.pdf, page 7).

0,,,,,,,How does damage control surgery differ from in-theatre surgery?,"Damage Control Surgery (DCS) and In-Theatre Surgery are two different concepts in military medicine as outlined in JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1. DCS is a range of surgical interventions targeted at halting deterioration of the patient's physiological condition, while attempting to maintain perfusion of essential tissues and organs (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, page 23). It is used when the physiological derangement is so severe that it is unlikely the patient would survive prolonged surgery. DCS aims to rapidly control haemorrhage and limit further damage, while In-Theatre Surgery is delayed until various physiological parameters have been restored to as close to normal as possible (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, page 13). In-Theatre Surgery usually requires a combination of general and orthopaedic surgery, including burns & plastic surgery where possible, and may consist of several surgical procedures spread over a period of time (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, page 13).

Therefore, the primary difference between DCS and In-Theatre Surgery is their timing and goal. Damage Control Surgery focuses on saving lives by controlling bleeding and maintaining perfusion in the immediate aftermath of injury or trauma, while In-Theatre Surgery aims to restore function to as close to normal as possible through a series of surgical procedures.

(References: 0501-0504","['This passage is from JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 2: "". Human Security is an approach to national and international security which places the emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state. Moving the security agenda beyond state security does not mean replacing it; rather, it complements and builds on it. It is applicable to situations above and below the threshold of armed conflict, across all domains and surpasses geographical boundaries. This pervasiveness of Human Security means that it is vital that it is considered across the spectrum of UK Defence. UK Defence’s Human Security approach is governed by international and domestic law and is underpinned by United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), NATO policies and the National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security. This JSP directs the UK Armed Forces to implement those UNSCRs which relate to Human Security considerations""  '

 'This passage is from JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 2: "". It explains why and how UK Defence must incorporate Human Security considerations in all that it does, from strategic planning through to the activity performed at the operational and tactical levels. In doing this, we will be able to better plan conflict sensitive outcomes by understanding the impacts on the human environment, minimising harm to civilians and reducing Human Rights’ violations, ultimately improving the conditions for stability. This policy reinforces the direction of the Integrated Operating Concept and recognises that the implementation of Human Security requires a whole of government approach, with military objectives integrated within a broader cross government strategy. By coordinating with other actors, we can shape the discourse on the security of human beings on the global stage and increase the prospects for long term peace and stability""  '

This chapter highlights that UK Defence must seek to address the following two questions: “How does Defence know HS is being used in military operations?” and “How is HS measured within military operations?”. The approaches at the strategic and operational levels will vary but the end state is similar. In considering these questions it should be borne in mind that Defence reporting will feed into wider UK government reporting for the strategies mentioned in para 0102 and is consistent with the language used by those departments. 0602.

The concept of HS integrates three freedoms: ‘Freedom from Fear’ (denoting violent threats to populations), ‘Freedom from Want’ (meaning poverty and absence of basic needs) and ‘Freedom from Indignity’ (which includes human rights abuses and limits on democratic participation). These have been developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to include all threats to the wellbeing of human beings and everything that affects the security of human beings.2 HS is an approach to national and international security which places emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state.
