Once decommissioned, the asset will ultimately require full demolition at some point and a land quality assessment is undertaken (b). The detailed planning for this process, including stakeholder actions, costs, and work required to achieve the new state, should be planned, authorized, and carried out as part of the specific asset project activity (paragraph 19) (c). No specific steps are mentioned in the text regarding how to initiate or carry out the decommissioning process itself.

Therefore, based on the provided reference text, no clear answer to the question can be given regarding the specific steps to take to decommission a bulk fuel installation. However, it is stated that the specialist petroleum engineering needed to carry out this type of work is not included in the document and responsibility for ensuring the work is carried out competently and complies with all relevant legislation lies with DIO, the MMO, and any specialist sub-contractors as required (JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 62)","['This passage is from JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 63: "". b. Decommissioning. When a bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset is no longer required on a permanent basis, it can be decommissioned. This is defined as subjecting the bulk fuel infrastructure asset to an engineering process that leaves it in a safe state8 without the need for further maintenance9. It is an irreversible process. As part of the specific asset project activity in paragraph 19, it would need to be decided whether the asset was going to be either: (1) Demolished in a short timeframe; or, (2) Decommissioned for the long-term and demolished at a later date. c.

 'This passage is from JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 63: ""a. A temporary reduction in the operational requirement to store petroleum products has created a redundant bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset, however, it is expected to be required again in the future and will need to be returned to service. b. A permanent reduction in the operational requirement to store petroleum products has created a redundant bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset that will not be returned to service. c. A bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset that is beyond economical repair. 17. If a situation relating to the information provided in paragraph 17 materialises, the bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset is not to be abandoned; instead the asset is to transition from an operational state to one of three other recognised states, detailed below in this paragraph. In such instances, stakeholder actions for the entirety of the project’s life, associated costs and the detailed work required to achieve the required new state is to be planned, authorised and carried out as part of the activity detailed in paragraph 19 (this is of paramount importance and must be adhered to). a. Mothballing. This defines a bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset that is not in use but is undergoing a maintenance programme that will enable it to be returned to an operational state in a pre-determined time-period. (1) Tanks. The time-period for a tank to remain in a mothballed state cannot exceed the next periodic inspection (clean, inspect, repair). As this is typically a periodicity of 5 to 8 years, that would be the maximum timescale a tank could remain in a mothballed state. The exact deadline for each specific project would need to be discussed and officially recorded as part of the specific asset project activity. (2) Pipelines. The time-period for a pipeline is harder to define, but it should be based on the known condition and on-going maintenance requirements. The exact deadline will depend on the specific asset project. It would need to be discussed and officially recorded as part of the specific asset project activity. b. Decommissioning.

0,,,,,,,What should I do in an emergency situation on a bulk fuel carrying vehicle?,"According to JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, in the event of an accident or emergency on a bulk fuel carrying vehicle, the members of the vehicle crew should take the following actions where it is safe and practicable to do so: apply the braking system, stop the engine and isolate the battery, avoid sources of ignition, inform appropriate emergency services, put on warning vests and place out warning signs, keep transport documents readily available, stay upwind and avoid inhalation of fumes, smoke, dusts and vapors, use fire extinguishers to put out small fires in tyres, brakes, and engine compartments (except for load compartment fires), prevent leakages into the aquatic environment or sewage system, move away from the vicinity of the accident, advise others to do the same, remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment, and follow the advice of emergency services (Annex B - BFCV Emergency Action Plan).

Additionally, when loading or unloading bulk fuel vehicles, drivers are required to report to the site control point/office for instructions on emergency procedures, loading operations, and traffic control systems (JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 184). Precautions against electrostatic charges and over-filling should also be taken when loading fuel (JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 182).

In case of a gas cylinder emergency, one should eliminate sources of ignition, ventilate the area, control access until it is safe, and call emergency services as appropriate (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0). If possible, remove the cylinder to a safe, well-ventilated area or test with an approved leak detection fluid. All leaking cylinders are to be made safe and unserviceable if maintenance is required (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).

For major emergencies involving bulk fuel vehicles, robust work instructions and well-exercised emergency procedures should be in place to mitigate the risk to life, property, and the surrounding community. Natural phenomena, accidents, and deliberate acts may initiate major emergencies (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0). Managers should also be familiar with the requirements of the Major Accident Control Regulations (MACR) and Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).

The fees include landing fees, parking fees, housing fees, and a Civil User Indemnity Administration Charge.

The landing fees are based on the Maximum Take Off Mass (MTOM) of the aircraft and vary depending on whether it is under or over 4 metric tonnes. Parking fees apply after the first 2 hours and are charged per 24-hour period or part thereof. Housing fees may be subject to a leasing or licensing arrangement with DIO for longer term parking. The Civil User Indemnity Administration Charge is separate from local charges and must be paid to recover the cost of MOD's insurance policy.

The specific charges can be found in Annex G and H of JSP 360 Part 2, which includes example landing fees and details on parking and housing fees. It is recommended that units set their own charges comparable to local civil airfield/airport charges.

Civilian users must comply with MOD’s insurance requirements as set out in Part 2.   3 Fees and Charges Introduction 1. The disparate geography, capability and MOD requirements of aerodromes do not lend themselves to centralised pricing. Additional seasonal and operational conditions may play a significant factor in defining rates. In any event it is important for units to not undercut local commercial airfields and as such unit Budget Managers assisted by DIO are encouraged to assess and set their own fees structure based on what the market will bear, with the approval of their TLBs. Ideally this should be done having regard to the full resource cost of providing the facilities and services increased to levels which equate to the prevailing market rate. This should be reviewed no less than annually. 2. Transparency in charging is essential to ensure the reputation of MOD is sustained. Additional charges should be articulated to applicants as far as possible in advance. Units should provide civil users with an estimate of total charges, including indemnity fees prior to accepting the civil aircraft. 3. Fees collected by units are held at TLB level. It is for the TLB holder to decide how income is dispersed3. TLBs are encouraged, as an incentive to units for providing services to civilian users, to allow a proportion of receipts to be retained at local level once Control Totals have been met. Reduced Charges 4. In certain circumstances MOD considers it appropriate to reduce some or all charges at MOD aerodromes. Further information on what charges may be abated or waived are in Part 2 Annex C. Value Added Tax 5.

The structure of the charges should be of a standard format and iaw ICAO 9082. Units should aim to provide applicants with the likely total costs for using their facility in advance. 15. Indicative charges for landing and navigation services at MOD aerodromes are detailed at Annex G and should be considered a benchmark rather than the minimum or maximum prices to be levied. It is for individual units to assess and frequently review their charges with the consent of their TLB2. No reduction in charges should be made because any aerodrome facilities are unavailable. Aerodromes may offer seasonal variations in price. When electing to do so this must be published in advance and take account of pricing at local civilian airfields offering similar services. 16. Services utilised by civil aircraft at MOD aerodromes must be provided without additional costs being incurred by MOD. Services are provided from irreducible spare capacity within the station or unit, which for wider strategic or other reasons must be retained. For example, Fire, Crash and Air Traffic Control services may have to be available 24 hours-a-day but are not fully utilised for defence tasks at all times and can therefore be used to handle civil aircraft within the spare capacity available. 17. Units may elect to approve civil aircraft out of normal watch hours. However, it is possible that the provision of these services could result in additional costs being incurred by MOD, e.g. civilian overtime or notional costs associated with calling out of Service personnel. To ensure that any such costs are recouped, civil aircraft movements outside normal watch hours should be subject to an additional surcharge. 18.

This document supersedes that issued on 1 February 2019. Issue 1. To provide clarification that civilian aircraft operators conducting Display Flying activity at MOD aerodromes must comply with MOD’s minimum insurance requirements of £50 million aviation liability insurance cover. This requirement does not relate to ‘static display’ aircraft and the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes should be followed if no Display Flying activity is being undertaken. Timing 2. With immediate effect. This policy statement remains extant until withdrawn or superseded. Introduction 3. Civilian aircraft operators conducting Display Flying activity at MOD aerodromes expose MOD to additional risks of compensation claims for either injury to personnel or damage to property. MOD must ensure that it is adequately protected against the consequences of these risks by ensuring that appropriate aviation liability insurance is in place to respond to a Display Flying related incident. Background 4. The recent comprehensive review of JSP 360 – Use of Military Aerodromes by Civil Aircraft – provided the opportunity to review insurance-related content and make a clear distinction between the insurance requirements of aircraft taking off and landing at a MOD aerodrome and those aircraft conducting Display Flying activity. 5. The issue was subsequently tabled for discussion with the Department’s professional insurance brokers, Willis Towers Watson, in the autumn of 2018. It was recognised that there is a clear distinction between routine operations and training and aircraft conducting Display Flying activity. Consideration was given to an appropriate insurance limit of liability relevant to the risk exposure at MOD aerodromes""  '

Q1. What is the definition of a Flying Display? A1. Any event at which Display Flying is deliberately performed for the purpose of providing an exhibition or entertainment. (A Flying Display is an event.) Q2. What is the definition of Display Flying? A2. Display Flying is any flying activity designed to demonstrate an Air Systems performance beyond that normally carried out during routine operations and training, whether or not it is performed in front of the public. A Public Display Authority (PDA), Display Authorisation (DA), Foreign Military Display Authority or civilian equivalent is required (except during Display Flying work-up training as per RA 2335(2)). (Display Flying is an activity.) Q3. Will a civilian aircraft, (a VIP visitor, pleasure flight or support aircraft for example) taking off or landing at a MOD aerodrome either before, during or after a Flying Display be required to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit? A3. There is no requirement for a civil user to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit unless the aircraft is conducting Display Flying activity. Therefore, the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes, as set out in JSP 360, should be followed. Q4. Will civilian aircraft participating solely in a static display be required to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit? A4. There is no requirement for a static display aircraft to increase insurance to the £50 million liability limit unless it is conducting Display Flying activity""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 360 Part 2.pdf, page 28: ""How the insurance policy is written will very much depend on the frequency of Display Flying activity undertaken by the pilot. Q6. Will the £50 million limit of liability apply to flypasts at Flying Displays for either singleton or formation aircraft? A6. The definition of a flypast in RA 2335 involves Air Systems flying, either singly or in formation, over or past a gathering of spectators along a pre-planned route without manoeuvring, other than when necessary for safe and accurate navigation. Accordingly, they will not include aerobatic manoeuvres. The risk is lower than Display Flying and there would not be a requirement to increase insurance to the £50 million limit of liability. Q7. Does the £50 million limit of liability apply to foreign military registered aircraft conducting Display Flying activity? A7. In the absence of any separate agreement (i.e. NATO Status of Forces Agreement for example) setting out the insurance position, the requirement for the £50 million limit of liability will apply for Display Flying. Q8. Will civilian users at MOD aerodromes or private display clubs require the £50 million limit of liability for practice displays at a MOD aerodrome on a regular or ad hoc basis? A8. MOD Heads of Establishment should assure themselves that practice Display Flying over MOD Occupied Property is conducted in such a way and at such a location as to ensure that Risk to Life is minimised. Where there are no spectators present for practice displays there is no requirement to increase the insurance limit of liability to £50 million. Q9. Is the £50 million limit of liability required for practice Display Flying over MOD occupied property where spectators are present? A9. Yes, because of the increased risk due to the presence of spectators. Q10. Does the £50 million insurance limit of liability apply to Parachute Display activity? A10. No; the risks of injury to spectators are not considered as high in comparison to aircraft Display Flying and the recommended minimum insurance limit of liability is £5M. Q11. Does the £50 million insurance limit of liability apply to civilian Search and Rescue helicopter demonstrations at MOD aerodromes? A11""  '

However, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to recover less than full cost in the short term for mutual benefit or humanitarian related issues (JSP 368.pdf, page 2, Annex 2.5, v).

When military assets are used to evacuate endangered individuals, costs do not lie with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for building situational awareness, pre-positioning assets linked to an evacuation, or use of MOD owned assets to assist with an evacuation; however, full cost recovery is sought for any non-evacuation related costs (JSP 368.pdf, page 2, Annex 2.5, 19).

In the context of contracts, the MOD does not normally fund services to external organizations and all costs must be recovered. Marginal costing is applied to reduce the overall cost of the prime procurement contract to Defence (JSP 368.pdf, page 2, Annex 2.11, 3). If a defence contractor is not able to fulfil the contract requirement without access to defence facilities, the defence contractor is effectively dependent upon the MOD and charges are raised accordingly (JSP 368.pdf, page 2, Annex 2.11, 4).

Details of the assistance to be provided in any particular set of circumstances are covered in the appropriate Military Aid to other Government Departments (MAGD) Index, which is issued by the Director Counter Terrorism and UK Operations (DCT and UK Ops). The use of Service personnel is authorised under the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations 1939 and the Emergency Provisions Act 1920 and 1964, which requires a state of emergency to be proclaimed and an Order to be signed by the Defence Council. The Department should normally seek to recover the full cost of assistance provided to Other Government Departments (OGDs) It may, however, be appropriate in some circumstances (e.g. mutual benefit to MOD and Other Government Department (humanitarian related issues etc.) to recover less than full cost in the short term.

b. the package is not of unusual dimensions or awkward shape (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10, page 3, criteria for Operations That May Not Require a Formal Risk Assessment, point c)

d. lift does not involve extremes of movement such as twisting (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10, page 3, criteria for Operations That May Not Require a Formal Risk Assessment, point e)

If the manual handling activity fits into all these criteria, then no formal risk assessment is required. However, it's important to note that even if a formal risk assessment is not necessary, adequate information, instruction, and training should still be provided to ensure the task can be carried out safely (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10, page 10, point c).

(Reference: JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10.pdf","['This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10.pdf, page 3: ""Risk Assessment 8. Before carrying out any risk assessment of manual handling operations, first determine whether it is reasonably practicable to avoid manual handling entirely by referring to the flow chart (Annex A). If, following this initial risk assessment, manual handling can be avoided, the manual handling assessment should be terminated and where necessary, movement of the load included in the tasks general risk assessment (JSP 375 Volume 1, Chapter 8). 9. If there is a requirement for manual handling, then a risk assessment should be conducted. This can be initiated by a dynamic risk assessment, which in some low risk environments may be sufficient to identify all necessary controls. Where the dynamic risk assessment is thought to identify significant risks, the risks will need to be recorded as a formal risk assessment. Operations Requiring No Formal Risk Assessment 10. The dynamic assessment will be sufficient if: a. loads weighing less than 3 kg, unless task has a high frequency; b. package is not of unusual dimensions or awkward shape; c. temperature is within a comfortable range; and d. lift does not involve extremes of movement e.g. twisting. 11. If the operation does not fit into all the above criteria, then a formal risk assessment may be necessary. Operations That May Require a Formal Risk Assessment 12. Annex B provides guidance weights for lifting and lowering for a fully fit adult; loads that fall within these weights do not normally require a detailed risk assessment to be carried out unless the activity is restricted by one or more of the following factors: a. the nature of the load (hot, cold, shape, size, ease of grip, etc.); b. the task or process involved (twisting or over-reaching, high work frequency and process rates etc); c. the capability of the individual (the ability to carry out manual handling safely varies between individuals; the published guidelines may be exceeded once the risk assessment process has been satisfactorily completed having taken into consideration the individual’s fitness, age, gender, health and / or previous injuries etc.); and d. the working environment (space, lighting, temperature, floor condition, etc.). 13""  '

Operations That Will Require a Formal Risk Assessment 15. Where lifting or lowering results in the hands moving out of the zones shown in Annex B, i.e. exceeding the weights stated, a formal risk assessment should be carried out. 16. It should be noted that the purpose of these guideline weights is to avoid wasting time and effort when conducting the risk assessment. They must not be regarded as safe weight limits for lifting. This is because there are too many other factors involved. 17. If a formal risk assessment is required, this should be completed by a competent person in conjunction with the manager and the personnel undertaking the manual handling operation (this can be done using the MOD Form 5012). Assessing the Risk 18. New assessments should be carried out using this guidance (which requires minimal training) and be conducted by ‘competent’ persons who have working knowledge of the processes and activities to be assessed. 19. Assessments should be carried out taking into account gender, age, and health etc. However, there is no need to assess every individual, it is quite acceptable to do a generic assessment that is common to a group of personnel and / or for similar operations. The main point is to identify the risk of injury and highlight how to make practical improvements. 20. Special consideration should be given when lifting operations are to be conducted by young people and new and expectant mothers (see JSP 375 Volume 1, Chapter 19 and 20) with respect to musculoskeletal damage to soft and developing bones / muscles of the individual and the unborn child. For activities or processes that contain a repetitive element, consideration should also be given to the potential for “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” (sore or inflamed joints ((mainly wrists and fingers)), tendon damage, etc). 21. The assessment should consider activities and processes, the environment, the individual and the load as well as the interfaces and accumulative effects of their component parts. Therefore, one of the first assessment activities is to: a""  '

If an item must be moved, the use of mechanical aids to eliminate the need for manual handling altogether should take primacy; if this option is not reasonably practicable then a review of the task should be undertaken to minimise the need for manual handling (e.g. reducing distance carried from point of delivery to end user). 36. Adequate information, instruction and training should be given in order to undertake the task safely. The type of training could comprise of a combination of the following: a. the “Manual Handling Awareness” course (Defence Learning Environment); b. a video; c. manual handling courses run internally and / or externally; d. on the job training; e. task specific training; and f. refresher training, this must be considered when risk assessments are reviewed. 37. A video must not be used as a substitute for practical instruction but can be used as part of the training package. The correct lifting techniques are illustrated in Annex C. 38. In some instances, there will be resource or other implications (e.g. contractual), which prevent the immediate implementation of control measures. Therefore, the short-term, medium-term and long-term measures should be stated: a. short-term measures may comprise stopping the activity, a briefing in safe lifting techniques, a removal of obstructions; b. medium-term measures could be the provision of mechanical handling aids; and c. longer-term could be the relocation of the storage area due to a unit move or rebuild. 39.

Failure to assess the health risks or to prevent exposures where reasonably practicable to do so is a breach of legislation. 5.

Although the use of lead in the workplace can be assessed using the COSHH process, the Control of Lead at Work Regulations (CLAW) specifies its own control requirements that differ slightly to those in the COSHH regulations.

For any COSHH assessment that includes the use of or exposure to lead, the requirements of CLAW must take primacy over those of the COSHH regulations. 7.

The MOD has signed up to a cross-government Corporate Eyecare Scheme (CES) which also caters for the provision of prescription safety eyewear. Where the provision of prescription safety eyewear is justified (e.g. work requiring a high degree of visual clarity that may be affected by standard eye shields), TLB / business units should have in place procedures for the use of the CES to provide personnel with prescription safety eyewear where it is required. If personnel choose not to use the CES as a matter of preference, they will not be eligible to reclaim any costs for prescription safety eyewear. 35. The CES is accessed through a pre-pay electronic online voucher system which entitles the individual to a pair of prescription safety glasses to the value of: a. £37.00 for single vision safety glasses; and b. £72.00 for bi-focal safety glasses. 36. Note: If the individual wishes to further upgrade from bi-focal to varifocal lenses or to a more expensive frame design, then they will be required to cover any further costs themselves. 37.

 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 12.pdf, page 8: ""ANNEX A TO JSP 375 VOL 1 CHAPTER 12 DSE User Guide 1. This guide has been prepared for all Defence personnel who are DSE Users (using DSE for more than an hour a day). It has been adapted from the Health and Safety Executive’s guide “Working with Display Screens”. This advice is primarily aimed for users of DSE on permanent workstations. Why Should I Read This Guide? 2. Display Screen Equipment (DSE) has become one of the most common kinds of work equipment; working with DSE can lead to physical (musculoskeletal) problems, visual fatigue and mental stress. These problems are not generally caused by the DSE itself but by how the DSE is used. It is important that you are aware of the risks, what you can do to avoid the risks and what the MOD is doing to reduce them. Do I Need Training to Use DSE? 3. All DSE users need some type of training prior to using DSE so they can avoid DSE related health problems. For general office DSE work the “Display Screen Equipment” course available through the Defence learning environment (DLE) should suffice; you may also be required to undertake other training e.g. touch-typing skills, and software training. What Should I Do If I Have Any Problems Associated with DSE Work? 4. If you think there is a problem with your DSE workstation or you have health problems e.g. back, shoulder and neck problems, eye problems (information about the specifics of your health condition can be kept confidential) connected with DSE work, then you must tell your manager. They can make the necessary arrangements through DBS-People Services / Local Medical Facility for further advice or a specialist assessment. 5. If your manager cannot assist you, you can ask your Representative of Employee Safety (Safety Rep) or Trade Union Representative for assistance. How Can I Avoid DSE Related Health Problems? 6. The guidance below will help you minimise the risk from use of DSE.  Support Your Back 7. When seated at your workstation, your wrists and forearms should be approximately horizontal with the floor. This can help prevent repetitive strain injuries. Your elbows should be by the side of your body so that the arm forms an L-""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 12.pdf, page 5: ""24. If personnel know or suspect that they are suffering from a DSE related condition, even after their workstation has been assessed and any necessary corrective action taken, they should inform their manager. 25. The user together with their manager should confirm acceptance of the assessment findings and the recommended actions of completing MOD Form 5016 (DSE user assessment). It is the responsibility of the user to comply with control measures put in place and make any necessary user adjustments to the workstation, taking regular breaks where practicable. Personnel who work from home (classed as ‘Remote Workers’ – see JSP 375 Volume 1 Chapter 21) will need to demonstrate that they know how to set up and assess their own workstation and complete both the workstation (MOD Form 5013) and (MOD Form 5016) the user DSE assessment. 26. Defence personnel may request a regular eyesight test (recommended at two yearly intervals) or if they suspect that they may require spectacles specifically for use with DSE. This should be actioned in accordance with next section of this chapter. DSE Eyesight Tests & Spectacles 27. There is no reliable evidence that work with DSE causes deterioration and / or damage to eyes or eyesight. In the majority of cases DSE users will not need spectacles specifically to work with DSE. The DSE regulations require employers to have in place provision for eyesight testing and if required, spectacles specifically for DSE use; consisting of basic frame and single vision lenses, normally within the 50-60 cm focal range. MOD has no obligation to provide eye tests / corrective spectacles that are required for everyday use. 28. Provision of multifocal lenses (bifocal or varifocal) may be appropriate if it would be impractical for an individual to keep changing their spectacles to perform their DSE related task e.g. where there is a high frequency of change (several times per minute) of focal length to read other text / media or when continually dealing with staff or public whilst using DSE. Corporate Eyecare Scheme(s) (CES) 29. The MOD has signed up to a cross-government Corporate Eyecare Scheme (CES) for the provision of DSE eye-sight tests and spectacles""  '

The use of the CES should result in a reduction of processing paperwork, and therefore, in significant cost savings to Defence over the system of individual reimbursement, whilst providing a wide range of styles and ability for personnel to contribute if they wish to upgrade to designer frames etc. Direct Reimbursement 33. If there is a strong business need for multifocal lenses, an appropriate business case will be required, and authorisation must be obtained using MOD Form 1003 prior to an eyesight test being carried out. A CES voucher should be used for the eyesight test and the direct reimbursement process used to reclaim the full receipted cost up to a maximum contribution of £80 for the spectacles. 34. Where there is no access to a CES outlet (e.g. a Permanent Joint Operating Base overseas), personnel are entitled to use the direct reimbursement process to recover: a. the full cost of a basic DSE eye-sight test fee; and b. the full receipted cost of spectacles up to a maximum contribution of £45 for frames and single vision lenses; or c. the full receipted cost of spectacles up to a maximum contribution of £80 for frames and multifocal lenses (when supported by an appropriate business case). 35. The MOD will not pay for: a. spectacles for sight defects which are worn to correct vision other than or in addition to the DSE 50-60 cm focal range; b. additional procedures (e.g. optomap, full field examination, tear assessment); c. the cost of tinted lenses or special coatings; d. designer frames; e. upgrade from bifocal to varifocal; or f. any fee raised by an optician for completing a MOD Form 1003. 36.

In such cases, you must obtain the relevant information from the supplier or acquisition team to make sure risks can be assessed and control measures implemented (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 8). Additionally, if personnel express concerns about exposure to a hazardous substance, they have the right to refuse work with it, but this must be discussed with you as their commander or line manager (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 8, Policy Statement 28). You are also responsible for ensuring that monitoring of exposure to hazardous substances is undertaken when an assessment concludes that there could be serious risks to health if control measures failed or deteriorated, exposure limits might be exceeded, control measures might not be working properly, or when employees are exposed to certain substances and processes specified in Schedule 5 to the COSHH Regulations (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 8, Policy Statement 30). Furthermore, you must ensure that those undertaking and interpreting exposure monitoring are competent to do so (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 8, Policy Statement 31).

In the context of vibration health effects, as a line manager, you are required to make sure that personnel who are suffering from such effects are informed, the vibration risk assessment is reviewed, exposure control measures are assessed, and significant findings from health surveillance are considered (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 26, pages 59-60). Personnel affected by vibration health effects must attend health surveillance as deemed appropriate by a doctor or referring specialist, and they should be assessed at least annually or as directed by Occupational Health or Service Health units (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 26, pages 60-61). You are also responsible for providing suitable advice and support to the affected person and ensuring they attend health surveillance as required (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 26, page 61).

This chapter provides guidance on the management of Occupational Health Surveillance (HS) and Occupational Health Monitoring (HM). Both HS and HM are led by Occupational Medical professionals (in industrial medicine (at work) or public medicine (control of disease and preventative medicine)). The links with occupational health and safety are concerned with the effects to the long-term health of the individual from their work and workplace; and the effects that their health may have on their work, sometimes linked to chronic conditions or exposure to substances or industrial practices harmful to humans (see also JSP 418). Health surveillance and health monitoring are medical services that offer tools to identify work-related disease or ill health to help minimise the effects to help the management of the health risks. The connection between cause and effect of work-related ill health is not always obvious; it can often take some time for symptoms to develop. For some personnel, a health issue will affect their ability to work or the type of work they can do. In other cases, the work itself may have the potential to affect a person’s health. 2. The majority of MOD civilians in the UK will receive their Occupational Health (OH) from the OH service provider via DBS People Services, according to their role. In some cases, civilian personnel may receive some OH services from military establishment and its medical facilities if they are based on those establishments and necessary arrangements are in place. 3.

 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 18.pdf, page 1: ""Part 1: Directive Introduction 1. This chapter sets out the direction and guidance on the health and safety issues related to Defence personnel working alone. A lone worker is a person who undertakes a specific activity unaccompanied or without immediate access to another person for assistance. It is not where individuals experience brief situations in which they find themselves alone, but where individuals are knowingly placed in circumstances where they work without supervision or immediate access to others. Background 2. Resource limitations and efficiency drives along with advances in telecommunications and information technology, has resulted in more activities potentially being carried out by lone workers. Lone workers may be exposed to greater risks than those conducting similar tasks as part of a team or under supervision. It is important therefore to identify Defence personnel who are lone workers, make sure there is awareness of the potential hazards and for the risks involved to be appropriately managed. 3. Employers are required to manage any health and safety risks before people can work alone. This requirement is covered by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 4. Lone workers are not to be placed at greater risk due to them working alone and if the risk assessment shows that it is not possible for the work to be done safely by a lone worker, then other arrangements must be put in place. 5. In addition to the practical reasons why lone working may not be possible, there may also be legislation that requires certain activities to be undertaken by more than one person, for example higher-hazard activity such as working in confined spaces, diving operations, and so on, therefore lone working is not an option. In the event you are unsure if lone working is possible, legal or health and safety advice should be sought. Key health and safety legislation 6. Employers have a general duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HSWA) to maintain safe working arrangements for their employees. There is a further duty on employers under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to carry out a risk assessment of the hazards to which their employees are exposed""  '

Some lone working activities might be conducted remotely from a person’s parent establishment, unit or site. In these circumstances, JSP 375 Chap 21 Managing Staff Remotely, must be consulted. 11. Commanders, managers and APs must, so far as is reasonably practicable, identify personnel who might be vulnerable to the hazards of lone working.

Wherever there is a potential of harm from manual handling activities, the risk should be assessed and evaluated by a competent person3 (in conjunction with the personnel undertaking the activity) who has knowledge of the process / activity, and in what environments the activity is likely to be carried out. If the person assessing the risk is not the manager, they should inform the relevant manager of the findings of the assessment and, if appropriate, explain the risks and the required control measures to manage them. All Personnel 7. All personnel should comply with Safe Systems of Work, training, etc. provided by management for manual handling activities and report any deficiencies that may be evident. Personnel engaged in manual handling should inform their manager or supervisor of any physical or medical condition that could affect their ability to undertake manual handling operations safely. 2 Schedule 1 of the Management of H&S at Work Regulations 1999 3 A person who has the training, skills, experience and knowledge necessary to perform a task safely and is able to apply them.

For dates covered by the AFCS, Service personnel have an obligation to report incidents. All three Services have accident notification cells and reporting chains. If a report of the incident was not created at the time, the Service person could reasonably be asked if he or she has a credible reason for not filing a report. If no such reason is forthcoming, then it may be assumed the incident did not necessarily take place as claimed. 2.44. Where there is reliable evidence that an incident occurred in the circumstances described by the individual, this does not necessarily mean that any injury arising from that incident is deemed to be caused by service. The material fact to which the missing record relates will be decided in the individual’s favour, not necessarily the whole claim.

There are many sources of electrical energy within the workplace, from small batteries in electronic systems, through power distribution systems at ELV, low voltage (LV), high voltage (HV) and up to static electricity and lightning. Variations in the voltage, current and the frequency of the electricity affects the way in which the electrical energy will act, but basically there are common dangers associated with all the different forms of electricity. 4. The dangers from electricity include the risk of electrical burns, electric shock and electrocution. A person forming a path for an electrical current to flow will suffer an electric shock or burn. The severity being dependent on the nature of the electricity, the duration of the contact, the amount of current which flows and the route it takes as it passes through the body.

The Lower Exposure Action Values (LEAV), Upper Exposure Action Values (UEAV) and Exposure Limit Values (ELV) for daily or weekly personal noise exposure and peak sound pressure are presented in the table below1. Lower Exposure Action Values (LEAV) Upper Exposure Action Values (UEAV) Exposure Limit Values (ELV) Daily or weekly personal noise exposure 80 dB(A-weighted) 85 dB(A-weighted) 87 dB(A-weighted) Peak sound pressure 135 dB(C-weighted) 137 dB(C-weighted) 140 dB(C-weighted) Table A-1 Noise exposure action and limit values 2. The daily or weekly personal noise LEAVs, UEAVs and ELVs presented above are time weighted average noise exposure levels. This means they are calculated from the average sound pressure level, for example 80 dB(A), and the time over which personnel are exposed to that average sound pressure level, for example 8 hours per working day. 3. As per the legislation, the values presented in the table above are shown for a nominal 8 hour working day or a nominal 40 hour working week2 3. This means that if an individual were exposed to an average of 80 dB(A) for 8 hours in a day, or for 40 hours in a week, then their personal exposure has reached the LEAV. Similarly, if an individual was exposed to an average of 85 dB(A), or 87 dB(A) for those same times, their personal exposure has reached the UEAV and ELV respectively. 4. The peak sound pressure values refer to any maximum sound pressure received which is typically from loud, impact type noises, for example explosions or percussive tools. The concept of the time weighted average noise exposure level is explained in the sections below. 1 The thresholds are presented in the logarithmic decibel (dB) scale. Decibels are typically rounded to the nearest whole number or presented to no more than 1 decimal place. The levels are ‘A-weighted’ (dB(A)) or ‘C-weighted’ (dB(C)). These weightings are outlined in ‘BS EN 6167201:2013 Electroacoustics. Sound level meters.

Additionally, a detailed vibration risk assessment is necessary for individuals operating or riding in armored vehicles, fast boats, vehicles or equipment on or off road, aircrew and passengers, and those with prior vibration-induced symptoms or who are medically susceptible. If the Vibration Hazard Check Questionnaire (VHCQ) in Annex C indicates a potential vibration exposure problem, then a detailed assessment is required (page 31). The commander, manager, or accountable person must record the findings and communicate them along with associated control measures to those exposed to harmful vibration levels (page 11). Vibration risk assessments must be regularly reviewed and updated if necessary (page 7). A review should take place no longer than 3 months after the detailed assessment and periodically thereafter, with more frequent reviews when changes occur in work activity or control measures (page 7)","['This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 26.pdf, page 31: ""ANNEX B TO JSP 375 VOL 1 CHAPTER 26 Vibration risk assessment process The following section presents a process for undertaking an initial vibration risk assessment and a detailed assessment if it is found to be required. Initial vibration risk assessment 1. The first step is to ascertain whether a vibration hazard is present. This is determined by completing the Vibration Hazard Check Questionnaire (VHCQ) in Annex C. The results of the VHCQ will determine whether a detailed vibration risk assessment is required. The VHCQ can be conducted by a commander, manager or accountable person and/or personnel familiar with the work environments and processes that generate vibration.11 2. If the VHCQ indicates that there is a potential vibration exposure problem a detailed vibration risk assessment is required. This should be undertaken in conjunction with MOD Form 5051 and MOD Form 5054. These forms should be referenced on the detailed vibration risk assessment as per Chapter 8 of JSP 375, Volume 1. 3. As an approximate guide, a detailed vibration risk assessment is likely to be necessary for: a. any proposed work activity where vibration exposure at a ‘notable level’ will be physically experienced at the hand for HAV or at the feet, buttocks or back for WBV; b. personnel will be operating or riding in Armoured vehicles (tracked and wheeled) and other tracked vehicles on or off-road, or wheeled vehicles off-road; c. personnel will be operating or riding in fast boats or in vehicles or equipment of any nature on or off road for example; B vehicles, AFV, C vehicles, plant and equipment, tracked or wheeled. d. Aircrew and passengers; and e. personnel with any prior vibration induced symptoms or who are medically susceptible. 4. It is difficult to define a ‘notable or significant’ vibration level that can be accurately judged by a non-expert. If in doubt, then initiate a detailed vibration risk assessment. However, a notable or significant vibration level may be present if: a. the vibration causes any sensation other than one where you simply ‘feel’ the vibration (for example, tingling, numbness, blurred vision, pain); b. the vibration feels greater than you would expect sat in a motorcar driving on maintained roads; c""  '

Assessing and Managing the Risk Avoiding Confined Space Working 11. Entry or work in confined spaces is to be avoided unless it has been determined that there is no reasonably practical alternative. 12. If the intended work is unavoidable the following should be considered: a. modification of the confined space so that entry is not necessary; b. have the work done from outside, e.g. inspection; sampling and cleaning operations can sometimes be done from outside the space using appropriate intrinsically safe equipment and tools; and c. intrinsically safe remote cameras may be used for internal inspection of confined spaces. Risk Assessment 13. If confined space working cannot be avoided, line managers should carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of the activity (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 8). For work in confined spaces this means identifying the hazards present, who will be exposed to the hazards, assessing the risks and determining what precautions to take. The assessment should include consideration of: a. the normal hazards associated with the task or activity; b. the working environment (lighting levels, cramped conditions, etc.); c. if access is needed to be controlled with standing instructions or a Permit-  to-work (PTW). d. working materials and intrinsically safe tools; e. the suitability and competence of those carrying out the task or activity; f. communications; and g. arrangements for emergency rescue. 14. When assessing and planning work involving confined spaces the following should be considered prior to the start of work. The following guidance is not exhaustive and line managers are to ensure they are satisfied that, so far as is reasonably practicable, all hazards are identified and adequately controlled.

This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance for the management of confined spaces. For MOD infrastructure projects specific additional requirements are specified in JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6 (which amplifies this chapter) in accordance with statutory requirements. 2. JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6 does not apply to military training conducted on the Defence estate that involves confined spaces, however, co-operation and co-  ordination will be required between those organising the training and those with responsibility for the control of the confined spaces. 3. A confined space can be any space which is substantially but not always entirely enclosed where there is a risk of death or serious injury from hazardous substances or dangerous conditions, e.g. a lack of oxygen. A significant number of people are killed or seriously injured in confined spaces each year in the UK. Those killed include not only people working in the confined space but those who try to rescue them without proper training and / or equipment. 4. Some confined spaces are fairly easy to identify, e.g. enclosures with limited openings: a. storage tanks; b. sewers, tunnels and pipes; c. some machinery spaces; d. trenches and pits; and e. ships compactors and ballast tanks. 5. Other confined spaces may be less obvious, but can be equally dangerous, e.g. unventilated or poorly ventilated work spaces. Some places may become confined spaces when work is carried out, or during their construction, fabrication or subsequent modification.""  '

PTW is a formal written authority to a named competent person to closely control an activity or process with a high level of residual risk (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 30, page 1). Therefore, it is necessary to have a permit to work system in place when the risks cannot be adequately controlled through other means and a formal check is required to ensure all elements of a Safe System of Work are in place before people are allowed to enter or work in a hazardous area.

This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance for the use of Permits to Work (PTW) to manage hazardous Defence activities with a high level of residual risk not already covered by Permit to Work procedure in JSP 375, Volume 3. 2. The MOD has a statutory duty to provide and maintain plant and systems of work, that are; so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risk to health. For high-risk activities, it is good practice to set-up a PTW system. The harmonisation of PTW systems between different locations can provide a familiar format and assist personnel moving between locations to understand the required controls and procedures to manage high risk activities. As systems become more complex, it is essential to coordinate them and understand inter-dependencies using the Safety and Environmental Case approach. It is therefore recommended that all new PTW systems or the revision / review of existing PTWs use the principles, guidance and templates contained within this leaflet. 3. A PTW is an effective means of controlling hazardous work activities and is a key element of the hierarchy or risk controls1. It shall be a formal written authority to a named competent person to closely control an activity or process, to which, following a risk assessment and the formulation of a Safe System of Work or a method statement, a high level of risk still exists. A PTW is the formalisation of a Safe System of Work but is not a guarantee of absolute safety. When Should a Permit to Work be Used? 4. A PTW should be used whenever it is intended to carry out any work which may adversely affect the safety of personnel, the environment or plant and equipment where assessment and the existing Safe System of Work do not fully mitigate the level of risk. A PTW is normal part of good-practice used as one of many risk control measures for activities such as maintenance work. 5""  '

If confined space working is unavoidable the manager should ensure a Safe System of Work is established and implemented. The following elements of a Safe System of Work should be adopted: a. the appointment of a Person in Charge (PIC); b. use the results of the risk assessment to help identify the necessary precautions and control measures to reduce the risk of injury; c. make sure that the Safe System of Work, including all the control measures identified, is developed and put into practice; d. ensure everyone involved is appropriately trained and instructed to make sure they know what to do and how to do it safely; and e. additional emergency procedures and recovery techniques. Permit-to-work (PTW) 16. Where the risk assessment requires the use of a PTW, this should be implemented in accordance with JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 30 or by adoption of the PTW system in JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6. A PTW allows a formal check to be undertaken to ensure all the elements of a Safe System of Work are in place before people are allowed to enter or work in the confined space.

This element provides the direction that must be followed and the guidance and good practice that should be followed and will assist users to comply with the requirements of legislation, regulation, policy and guidance that are set out in Element 3 of the Volume 1 to JSP 815 (this JSP). Purpose and expectations 2. This element is to assist Defence organisations to identify and communicate the requirements of legislation, policy, regulation and guidance surrounding safety in Defence and to assist Defence organisations to put in place good practices and drive continual improvement within their organisation. Legislation and policy Compliance with safety legislation 3. Within the UK, Defence is required to comply with all applicable safety legislation unless covered by a disapplication, exemption or derogation (DED). This includes legislation giving effect to the UK’s international obligations. Most safety law applies across GB, with complimentary statute in the Northern Irish assembly (NI). 4. In addition, the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) requires employers to “prepare and as often as may be appropriate, revise a written statement of his general policy with respect to the health and safety at work of his employees”. For these purposes, the Secretary of State (SofS) for Defence is regarded as the employer and complies with this duty through a Policy Statement. The SofS’s Policy Statement identifies the key requirements and high-level responsibilities for Health Safety and Environmental Protection (HS&EP) which applies to all Defence activities and personnel. 5. In accordance with the SofS’s Policy Statement, when deployed overseas, Defence will comply with the laws of host states, where they apply, and where such requirements fall short of UK requirements, Defence commits to apply UK standards so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so. 6. Domestic legislation will not always extend beyond the UK’s geographical limits. However, there are exceptions where UK legislation expressly extends beyond that""  '

0,,,,,,,How do I prevent legionella disease outbreaks?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32.pdf, preventing legionella disease outbreaks involves several steps. First, Accountable Persons (APs) must appoint a Responsible Person (RP) to manage the control of legionella and provide advice (Policy Statement 1). The RP is responsible for maintaining their competency and knowledge of all water systems, making sure the Legionella Management Policy Statement (LMP) remains current and accessible, and maintaining regular contact with the AP.

Second, APs must identify all sources within their Area of Responsibility (AoR) that present a risk of inhalation of legionella bacteria (Policy Statement 2). This includes considering factors such as water temperature, storage or recirculation, nutrients, conditions that encourage bacterial growth, and the potential for water droplets to be dispersed.

Third, APs must ensure a suitable, sufficient, and effective system is in place to monitor the LMP, risk assessments, and all systems identified as a potential legionella risk (Policy Statement 3). Commanders, managers, APs, and the RP must review risk assessments regularly and make sure control measures are maintained.

Fourth, personnel should be familiar with the symptoms of Legionellosis and report any health and safety concerns to their commander, manager, RP, or AP (Policy Statement 5).

Finally, in case of an occurrence where someone contracts Legionellosis, immediate action must be taken to identify and isolate the source, and procedures must be in place for reporting the occurrence to the relevant authorities (Policies Statement 4 and 25).

Safety culture 10. Leaders in Defence set the strategic direction for safety which influences how individuals within Defence behave in relation to safety and defines the culture of the organisation. 11. Culture can be best understood as ""the way we do things around here"" and safety culture can be defined as “the product of individual and group values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies and patterns of behaviour that determine the commitment, style and proficiency of the organisation\'s safety management.” A safety culture builds slowly, but behaviours are influenced quickly through strong leadership, messaging, expectations, and examples, this is known as the ‘tone from the top’. 12. Building a strong culture of safety is vital to prevent accidents, injuries and deaths. Defence organisations should show genuine care to those who deliver Defence activities, support open and honest reporting and set a culture where everyone feels able to speak up before and not just after things go wrong, rather than fearing blame. They should maintain policies and processes that develop and promote a positive safety culture throughout their organisation and area of responsibility, they should share and effectively communicate good practice and any safety lessons identified in order to promote and support continuous improvement. Clear aims and objectives 13. Defence organisations have flexibility to describe the elements of a strong safety culture using their own language. However, clear aims and objectives are important as they ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and all involved parties take the right steps in achieving an effective safety culture""  '

If asbestos is identified or suspected following the assessment, commanders and managers must identify who may be at risk of exposure, assess the risk, implement appropriate control measures, inform the operation or exercise plan, and record the information in a local asbestos register (47-50). The text also suggests that undamaged bonded materials such as insulating board and asbestos-cement, if functional and in good condition, may be sealed or encapsulated (23). Therefore, to determine if your workplace has asbestos, a competent person should conduct an EIH assessment. If asbestos is identified, appropriate control measures must be implemented to reduce the exposure risk to a level that is ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable), and personnel must be informed of the presence of asbestos and provided with necessary PPE (47-50).

Calibration. WBGT monitors require annual calibration to remain accurate. Calibration is undertaken by Defence Electronics & Components Agency (DECA). It is the responsibility of the holding organisation to ensure that the WBGT remains in date for calibration and it is also their responsibility to contact DECA to request this service. Monitors are to be dispatched to DECA5 and accompanied with a MOD Form 1773 ‘Request for Calibration’. Turn-around time is routinely 14 days from the date DECA receive monitors, but a quicker Urgency of Need can be requested on the Form 1773. For queries relating to items sent for calibration, the DECA Helpdesk can be contacted on: tepl.helpdesk@deca.mod.uk or 01244 847365 / 95541 7365. Wherever possible, organisations should arrange for calibration to occur over the cooler months of the year in order to maximise availability of WBGT during the period when risk of thermal stress is highest. Commanders should ensure that there are an adequate number of calibrated WBGTs available throughout the year. This can be achieved with a robust and regular calibration programme spread across a 12 month period. 4. Repair. In recognition of the importance of the WBGT monitor capability and the current issues around QT-34 WBGT procurement, authorisation is in place for repair to follow the Direct To Repair (DTR) route rather than the normal Planned Repair loop. All requests for DTR are to be emailed to Jo.Snowden@babcock.r.mil.uk. However, units may wish to seek advice by phone (01952 967427) in the first instance. On receipt of DTR requests, organisations will be invited to send the damaged monitor to a designated contractor, allocated by Babcock DSG.

A WBGT reading is the best way of factoring environmental conditions into a risk assessment, as it takes account of temperature, humidity, wind speed and sunlight. The WBGT is a combined measure of the dry-bulb temperature (the air temperature), wet-bulb temperature (the temperature the air can be cooled to through the effect of evaporation) and globe temperature (a temperature reading that takes account of the effect of sunlight, air temperature and wind speed). It is measured in degrees Celsius. You can use the QT34 monitor to check the difference between the dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature. When the two numbers are close, the humidity is high and the risk of heat illness is increased. This is because the higher humidity prevents sweat from evaporating.

1. Hold early planning briefs to inform participants about medical support and recommendations.
2. Inspect ceremonial uniforms for correct fitting.
3. Increase salt intake (1-2 teaspoons per day) and water intake (2 liters per day) for the week prior to the event.
4. Stay cool as long as possible on the morning of the event by changing into ceremonial uniform late.
5. Attend all rehearsals for heat acclimatization.
6. Avoid alcohol 48 hours before the event.
7. Have a light/early breakfast.
8. Produce, resource, and rehearse an increased medical plan to support the event.

Additionally, consider the following precautions from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 41 Annex B.pdf (page 1):

1. Wear appropriate clothing and remove layers if necessary during strenuous activity.
2. Stay adequately hydrated by drinking enough water to maintain clear, light-yellow urine.
3. Avoid stimulants, diuretics, energy drinks, antihistamines, decongestants, NSAIDs, opioids, methylphenidate, and weight-loss or performance-enhancing supplements before and during exercise.
4. Report any discomfort or physical distress that is not normal to a commander and ask for medical attention.
5. Treat heat illness by moving the casualty to shade, removing heavy clothing, spraying or drizzling water over light clothing, fanning air, and providing cool water if conscious. Alert the commander or line manager and medical cover, and consider evacuation for moderate and severe cases.

For young people, such as cadets, extra precautions must be taken due to their reduced ability to thermoregulate (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 41.pdf, page 11). Prevent sunburn by wearing appropriate clothing and headwear, working in the shade, and applying water-resistant sunscreen.

Hypothermia can develop slowly e.g. during a cold UK Exercise, or rapidly, e.g. during immersion or extreme cold. Hypothermia is also a risk to casualties with moderate to severe injuries in any climate. Cold injury includes whole-body cooling, i.e. hypothermia, and cooling of the extremities such as hands and feet, i.e. freezing cold injury (FCI) or non-freezing cold injury (NFCI). NFCI is the most common of these and mostly occurs in the UK during training Exercises. Non-Freezing Cold Injury (NFCI) is caused by gradual, prolonged cooling of the hands or feet. It does not have to be freezing to get an NFCI; most cases occur in the UK during training.  Freezing Cold Injury (FCI) happens in sub-zero temperatures and includes frost nip and frost bite. Parts of the body most prone to freezing are the extremities and exposed areas, e.g. nose, ears, fingers and toes.

This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance on health and safety issues related to the disposal, closure or transfer of control of Defence establishments. 2. Achieving the effective transfer of control, closure or disposal of Defence estate or establishment is a complicated process, which requires careful planning and the provision of significant resources. The activities, facilities, plant, equipment and the associated risks may differ considerably between establishments. Resources to manage them through any transitional period needs to be tailored to the constantly changing workplace environment and risk profile. The transfer of control can be between TLBs and agencies or between the MOD and a business partner as part of a Private Finance Initiative, Public & Private Partnership (PFI / PPP), etc. 3. The closure and subsequent disposal of Defence estate or an establishment should be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) Functional Standard, Design Maintenance Guide 12 (DMG 12) - Site Closure Guide - which may also be used in part as further guidance for the handover of an establishment between TLBs / agencies.

The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) require the MOD to assess the risk of harm to personnel from fires or explosions involving dangerous substances in the workplace. These risks must be eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable. The aim is to both prevent harm to Defence personnel, contractors, visitors and members of the public who may be put at risk, and to minimise collateral damage. 2. The Regulations complement the requirement to manage risks under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations and transpose two European Directives (the Chemical Agents Directive (98 / 24 / EC) and the Explosive Atmospheres Directive (99 / 92 / EC)) into UK legislation. They also replace older regulations dealing with flammable substances safety. 3. DSEAR deals with the immediate danger to life or health from fires or explosions resulting from the ignition of dangerous substances and should not be confused with COSHH which deals with the chronic and acute health effects of exposure to substances hazardous to health. Processes and the storage involving dangerous substances that require a DSEAR assessment will also require COSHH assessments. 4. The manufacture, handling, use, storage and transport of explosives is not covered in this chapter, these requirements are covered in specific Joint Service Publications (JSPs) and Defence Regulations (DSA02).""

The safety case should provide justification that the equipment is safe to use and aid in its design and acquisition programme planning (paragraphs 16 and 17). It should also consider activities beyond normal operation and training, manufacturing, testing, commissioning, transporting, storing, maintaining, and disposing of the equipment safely (paragraph 17). Safety cases must be updated to match the configuration of the equipment and when there is a material change to its understanding, risk profile, design, or operation (paragraph 18). The safety performance of the equipment should be monitored throughout the in-service phase for sustaining safe performance, and any safety-related issues identified must be acted upon and recorded in the safety case (paragraph 18).

JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 25.pdf, page 20 states that safety cases should be produced for equipment and platforms to identify the location of noise hazards produced by the equipment and/or platform.

JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7.pdf, pages 5-6 provide considerations for safety as part of the acquisition process, including whether a safety case approach is proportionate given the complexity of the equipment and the level of risk involved (paragraph c). If a safety case is required, it must capture all the safety related risks associated with that equipment and evidence how these risks will be managed to as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level (paragraphs 14 and 15).

Therefore, to produce a safety case for a new piece of equipment, one should start early in the acquisition process, consider all potential hazards and risks associated with the equipment, design, manufacturing, testing, commissioning, transporting, storing, maintaining, and disposing of it safely. The safety case must provide compelling evidence that the equipment is safe for its intended application in a given operating environment and be updated as necessary to reflect changes or material developments.

Construction of the safety case for an equipment should start as early in the acquisition lifecycle as possible and should be an integrated part of the equipment design, rather than a supplementary activity. As well as providing a justification that the equipment is (or will be) safe to use, the safety case should be an aid to its design and the planning of the acquisition programme. Planning in advance the safety argument that the SRO hopes to be able to make when a system is delivered and used in service should inform the safety requirements for the equipment, and the type of activities that will be necessary in the acquisition programme and during operation to generate the evidence to support the safety case. This information should in turn support decisions such as the choice of supplier and whether to use a bespoke, off-the-shelf or customised design. 17. Safety cases for equipment should be forward-looking and take into account activities beyond normal operation and training. They must also consider how equipment can be manufactured, tested, commissioned, transported, stored, maintained and disposed of safely. Stakeholder input will be required to validate assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other DLODs. Input from human factors specialists is also likely to be required to ensure these activities can be carried out safely and easily. Risk controls that cannot be put into practice easily are unlikely to be effective. 18. Safety cases should be updated to match the configuration of the equipment and when there is a ‘material change’ to the understanding, risk profile, design or operation of the equipment.

Original Original  In some cases, occupying troops have operated indirectly through an existing  or newly appointed indigenous government. This type of occupation is not discussed in detail in this chapter. In such cases, despite certain differ-  ences from the classic form of military occupation, the law relating to military occupation is likely to be applicable. Legal obligations, policy  considerations, and external diplomatic pressures may all point to this  conclusion.  Patrols, commando, and similar units, which move on or withdraw after  carrying out their mission, do not normally occupy territory since they are  not there long enough to set up an administration. The use of airborne forces  and of mechanized warfare may make it difficult to determine whether  occupation exists. When hostilities continue in enemy territory, occupation  only arises in areas coming under the control of the adverse party, even if  that control is only temporary, provided that measures are taken to admin-  ister the areas in question. Occupation does not take effect merely because  the main forces of the country have been defeated but depends on whether  authority is actually being exercised over the civilian population. However,  for occupation of an area it is not necessary to keep troops permanently  stationed throughout that area. It is sufficient that the national forces have  withdrawn, that the inhabitants have been disarmed, that measures have  been taken to protect life and property and to secure order, and that troops  are available, if necessary to enforce authority in the area.

The provisions of the law of armed conflict  that relate to occupied territory apply to belligerent occupations.  The present chapter does not cover situations where the military forces of  one state are in the territory of another allied state in pursuance of a treaty  or agreement between allies. In those cases, the matter is governed by the  treaty or agreement.5 Nor does this chapter apply to cases of international  administration of territory, for example by the United Nations or other  international organizations, which will usually be governed by a complex  of legal instruments establishing and regulating such administrations. In  cases of liberation of allied territory, or in cases where troops are sent in to a collapsed state6 to restore law and order, it may not always be possible to  conclude a civil affairs agreement with the authorities of the country con-  cerned in advance so that there will be de facto military rule by the liberating  power.7 The rules of international law applying to occupied territory  should, so far as possible, be applied by analogy until an agreement is con-  cluded. Where a belligerent liberates part of its own territory before normal  civil government can be restored, the extent of the military authorities’  powers is a matter of the domestic law of the belligerent concerned.8  Definition of Occupation  Territory is considered to be occupied when it is actually placed under the  authority of external military forces. Occupation extends only to territory  where that authority has been established and can in fact be exercised.9  Effectiveness of Occupation  To determine whether a state of occupation exists, it is necessary to look at  the area concerned and determine whether two conditions are satisfied:  first, that the former government has been rendered incapable of publicly  exercising its authority in that area; and, secondly, that the occupying  power is in a position to substitute its own authority for that of the former  government.  11.2  11.3  Occupied Territory  275  11.1.2  5 Such as the NATO Status of Forces Agreement of 19 June 1951.""

Therefore, this chapter defines the responsibility of a commander, manager or accountable person as someone who has a delegated managerial or supervisory responsibility for activities or equipment that may result in the exposure of Defence personnel to excessive noise whilst at work. The noise levels must be managed through the use of control measures to reduce exposure to a level that is ALARP and tolerable. This includes design of equipment at the procurement stage to prevent or minimise noise exposure to levels that are ALARP and tolerable. 23. The above definitions imply that there will likely be several individuals who together share responsibility for reducing noise exposure. All personnel have a duty to work together to assess the risks and to make sure Defence is compliant with the policy statements in this chapter and therefore the legislation. 24. Whilst the primary responsibility for the welfare and H&S of personnel rests immediately with the commanders, managers or accountable persons of those personnel, this duty usually cannot be discharged without the proactive actions of other managers or responsible people. This can take the form of procuring equipment that is inherently of low noise design, directly supporting implementation of suitable measures, review and audit of an action plan, enforcing culture, standards of behaviour and adherence to policy, and so on. 25. The commander, manager or accountable person should first look at the site hazard assessment or safety case report, which should have identified the areas where work activities could produce excessive noise. 26. In each of these areas an initial assessment must be carried out to identify whether there is a potential noise hazard and whether a more detailed noise assessment may be required. A ‘Noise Hazard Check Questionnaire’ (NHCQ) is designed for this purpose and is presented in Annex C to this chapter. 27. The commander, manager or accountable person should make sure that an NHCQ is carried out by or in conjunction with a person familiar with the work environment and processes. The person does not need to have had noise assessor training to undertake this task. 28""  '

Level of responsibility  The level at which the legal responsibility to take precautions in attack rests  is not specified in Additional Protocol I. Those who plan or decide upon  attacks are the planners and commanders and they have a duty to verify  targets, take precautions to reduce incidental damage, and refrain from  attacks that offend the proportionality principle.

It is acceptable in certain situations, especially where there is a justified desire to dispel false suspicions of the presence of nuclear weapons, to couple NCND with other existing official statements, such as the SDR statement that Trident is the UK’s only nuclear weapon system and the obvious fact that Trident can only be carried on a submarine, to enable the hearer to draw their own conclusions.  On the same basis, it is also acceptable to state whether a certain site has facilities for storing nuclear weapons.  DNO-Nuclear-Policy should be consulted for forms of words that can be used in particular circumstances.  The NCND policy does not apply to SNM.  The following guidance applies to all situations involving UK nuclear weapons (including operations at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), nuclear weapons convoys, and operations at HMNB Clyde), arising from an incident or emergency or malicious intervention by a third party.

According to the text, an approval is required before any disposal or discharge of radioactive waste can take place (JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, p. 26). The disposal must then be carried out in accordance with the conditions of the approval (JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, p. 27). Additionally, advice on the application of exemption limits and conditions for disposing of low volume VLLW should be sought from an RWA (JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, p. 28-29). Therefore, the approval process for disposal of radioactive waste involves seeking approval from the environmental agencies, adhering to the conditions of the approval, and consulting an RWA for advice on exemption limits and conditions.

A Gallery Range (GR) is an open LDA range originally constructed to imperial dimensions in yards (yds) or subsequently converted or partially converted to metres (m) with firing points at 100 intervals normally up to 600. On some ranges the 100 - 400 firing points only are converted to metric. For ease of reference firing points will be referred to as 100, 200 etc with no suffix. This range has a markers\' gallery and a stop butt. The common range layout has 12 firing lanes each 4m wide. Targets are manually operated by the markers in the butts. 1502. Aim.

In accordance with Health and Safety at Work Regulations, protection for maintenance staff should be provided where there is an open drop into the gallery. The minimum measure is a steep drop warning sign at each end of the mantlet. The type protection provided on the mantlet is to be dictated by local risk assessment based on the degree of permitted and unauthorised access onto the mantlet. 1529. Construction Of Shoot In Boxes. Shooting in boxes are provided to take the majority of rounds fired during 50 m ACQM shoots and as such need to be constructed around each target array. The boxes are to be made of a soft material such as timber that will not generate hard ricochet. There will always be wide shot that will damage the materials used in constructing these boxes so this should be taken into consideration when choosing the material used. Also on ranges where LMG or GPMG are used extensively, attrition on the mantlet may be high. Refer also to Reference B that describes the use of plastic timber. Targets are normally positioned in pairs within a 4 m lane on Gallery Ranges. Mantlets vary greatly in layout so the actual size and position of shooting in boxes may vary from range to range; a typical layout is shown below: 1530. Falling Plate Targets. Falling plate shooting-in boxes set into the face of the mantlet lower the CofF, which increases the risk of ricochet off the range floor and therefore requires the 2900 m RDA template to be applied (see Figure 19-2). To avoid lowering the CofF, shooting-in boxes may be set into the stop butt between target frames on the normal LofS. However, as this creates a backsplash hazard, the markers\' gallery should not to be manned. To fire falling plate practices on gallery ranges without the need to increase the Gallery RDA, falling plate boxes or covers over the steel plates mounted on the mantlet may be used (5.56 mm only; refer to TAS for details). Only the issued falling plate targets are to be used (see Chapter 29).""  '

1. Quality: The sand should conform to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"" and its grading should conform to BSI PD 6682-1 Table D1, ""0/4 Concrete Sand CP."" It should be angular in shape for slope stability and sound physical properties. The sand should not readily breakdown naturally and should not crush to fine dust when rubbed between the hands.
2. Construction: The core of the bullet catcher may be constructed of any stable inert fill material, but the surface is to be covered by sand as specified in the relevant chapter for the range. The depth of sand depends on the type of weapon fired and ranges from 750 mm (S) to 1000 mm (C) in the direction of the line of fire.
3. Profile: The front face of the bullet catcher should have a recommended slope of 340 (600 mils) to reduce the risk of ricochet. The slope must never fall below 300 (530 mils) as this may cause ricochet to leave the RDA.
4. Maintenance: Sand will gradually reduce to fine dust behind the MPI and will need to be replaced over time. Careful inspection of the hard structure behind the soft cladding is required if anti-backsplash or ricochet protection surfaces have been added to hard defence structures","['This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 403 Volume 2 Range design criteria and specifications Edition 3 Change 6 SAND BULLET CATCHERS 02110. General. Sand has been generally used in bullet catchers and stop butts on many of the ranges described in this Volume. This section specifies the quality of the sand, its profile and maintenance that are necessary to capture shot without causing ricochet or backsplash. Wet sand will have the tendency to form tunnelling on ranges where tight grouping is expected which may result in penetration of the bullet catcher. 02111. Quality. It is recommended that sand conforming to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"". Grading should conform to BSI PD 6682-1 Table D1, ""0/4 Concrete Sand CP"" with angular shape for slope stability and sound physical properties to resist natural breakdown.\' This grade is fine enough not to cause ricochet yet coarse enough to retain the required profile effectively without likelihood of setting or forming a surface crust; it is also relatively stable in high winds. This specification also provides for a material that will not readily breakdown naturally, such material should not crush to fine dust when rubbed between the hands. Over time bullets pounding the sand reduce it to fine dust behind the MPI, at this point the sand will need to be replaced. 02112. Construction. The core of the bullet catcher or stop butt may be constructed of any stable inert fill material. However, the surface is to be covered by sand as specified in the relevant Chapter for the range. Generally the depth of sand is related to the type of weapon fired. For high velocity weapons (see Table 4), the depth of sand measured on a line parallel to the LofS should be 1000 mm (S) 900 mm (C) For low velocity weapons the depth should also be 750 mm (S) 500 mm (C) in the direction of the line of fire. 02113. Profile. 340 (600 mils) (C) is the recommended slope for the front face of the bullet catcher in order to reduce the risk of ricochet.

Traditional sand bank with canopy or 100m Range Danger Area. The traditional sand bullet catcher with a 900 mm depth of sand at 34° (600 mils) is a safe, reliable and proven design. It is safe for automatic fire in short bursts. To capture high angle ricochet and 7.62mm pop over, a canopy of minimum 180mm thick timber (rail sleeper) or steel plate should cover the target area. If there is sufficient space, a 100m RDA may eliminate the requirement for a canopy. Section 2 – Typical bullet trap using sand natural angle of repose (30 – 34deg) 1151. Target Selection. When selecting targets and target mechanisms, the difficulty of moving down the range to mark or change targets should be borne in mind as target retrieval systems cannot easily be installed in the tube. An automatic marking system and a simple turning target mechanism will greatly enhance the range and the training value. Fall-when-hit systems are difficult on a tube range as the concentration of the sound energy in the tube may activate the mechanism without the target being struck. The Figure 11 remains the target of choice for military practices but requires a large diameter tube. Representative targets, sized to give the appearance of targets at greater ranges provide valuable training on shorter ranges. To minimise the risk of ricochet off the tube walls, targets must be presented centrally in the tube. Multi-point targets should not be used unless the range has been specifically designed for this type of target. 1152. Ricochet and Backsplash. Refer to paragraph1110. 1153. Target Illumination.

The traditional sand faced bullet catcher is ballistically suitable for all weapons. Details of sand bullet catchers are provided in Chapter 2. It is however not the ideal solution indoors due to the dust and cleaning problems associated with such traps. 0325. Vertical Steel Plate with Anti-Splash Curtain. Existing low velocity ranges traditionally have the minimum requirements outlined in Figure 3-5. In this case the bullet catcher and the backplate are to be firmly fixed to a sound brick, blockwork or concrete wall. Steel plates should be mounted so that sheets are flush to each other, preferably with fixings made flush. The bullet catcher plates should be so arranged that the target positions will not coincide with the edges of the steel sheet. This design is the minimum requirement for rimfire weapons. It is simple and reliable, and breaks up the round on impact. Backsplash is prevented by an anti-splash curtain in front of the plate. A timber batten on the floor behind the curtain helps contain lead fragments. The main disadvantage of this trap is noise and the lead dust generated by bullet impact on the steel plate. The size and thickness of steel plate may be determined from Chapter 2 Tables 6 and 7. To minimise reverberation and noise when the bullet catcher is struck, an absorbent layer should be sandwiched between the steel sheet and the back wall. A sacrificial plate will increase durability at the MPI, especially if centrefire pistol is to be fired. As continued strike will buckle this plate, it should be fixed to allow for creep. Fixing bolts and screws should be countersunk. 0326. Angled Steel Plate with Anti-Splash Curtain. A single steel plate deflects rounds downwards to a bullet stop at floor level. It is effective but less safe and reliable than the vertical plate. Deflected rounds may not behave in a predictable manner and there is a much higher reliance placed on the anti-splash curtain. Multiple deflectors of the ""Venetian blind"" type are only to be used with an anti-splash curtain fixed in front of and clear of the bullet catcher. 0327. Snail Bullet Trap""  '

Description. The basic training grenade range has up to three throwing bays. To the left of the bays is a troop assembly building and to the right a dispersal building for those who have practised. An impact area of approximately 41 x 21 m is forward of the throwing bays and behind them is a protected tower designed to provide clear unobstructed observation into the throwing bays and protection for the RCO. 2204. Purpose. This range is for initial and refresher training. It cannot provide realistic operational or advanced training. RANGE DANGER AREA 2205. The RDA has a radius of 250 m extending all round the impact area (see Figure 22-1). The current grenade, L109 has a danger area of 200m from point of detonation. The impact area must be open to view by the safety supervisors in the throwing bays. The DA should be clear and open to view from the RCO\'s control tower; where this is not possible control measures must be in place which allows the RCO to be confident that the DA is clear. It may be necessary to post sentries to cover blind spots. An area to the flanks of the prepared impact area extending 20m beyond the prepared impact area must be kept well maintained in order to locate and clear any blind grenade thrown wide. Movement within the RDA beyond the clear area is to be restricted due to the possibility of blinds unless that area can be cleared by the RCO following the destruction of a blind.

Grenade ranges not conforming to the current criteria for the Basic Grenade Range may be used to train soldiers in tactical grenade training, but only when the range conforms to the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2218 and 2219. The Exercise Director and Exercise Planning Staff are to ensure the use of any constructed tactical grenade facility is safe for the practices to be undertaken and sufficient protection is provided for both exercising troops and safety staff. CONSTRUCTION 2218. Field Firing Area Tactical Grenade Range. Tactical grenade practices do not necessarily require a constructed range as suitable natural cover may be used. However, an example of construction for a semi-permanent tactical throwing grenade trench is shown in Figure 22-2 with grenade posting trenches shown in Figures 22-3 to 22-5. The area around these facilities requires careful selection to ensure full protection for grenadiers and safety staff and to locate and dispose any blinds. The standard grenade range mitigates errors of drill but this margin of safety is not available for tactical throwing. The minimum safety standards for a LFTT tactical grenade range are: (a) Range Danger Area. A 250 m (200 m for L109) radius RDA around the impact area over which safety staff can exercise control. (b) Siting. The impact area must be dry and firm ground with no more than light vegetation. No trees, hanging branches rocks or any obstruction that might deflect the grenade should be between the throwing position and the targets. (c) Protection – Bunker and Shell Scrape. Sufficient natural or constructed cover for all troops, including sheltering troops in fighting order, within the RDA is to be equivalent to the illustration in Figure 22-5 at Section XX: (1) A minimum thickness of 750 mm of well compacted soil across the full height and width of the required cover.

An earth bank behind the armour plate to provide additional stability and to enhance the appearance may complicate the clearance of blinds should a grenade pass through a hole in the plate and not detonate. If a bank is considered necessary, it should be constructed clear of the steel plate so that blinds may be dealt with safely.

At high frequencies absorption will be much higher, so much so that high frequency nuisance over these sample distances can be ignored. 3116. Temperature Gradients. These have effects like those of wind gradients and, similarly, are not as yet capable of prediction. An inversion may increase sound transmission but it is not known how often this condition may obtain in any given locale.

An example is given below of a theoretical prediction of sound attenuation, at distances of 1500 metres and 1650 metres from an SLR. As high frequencies, i.e. above 1000 Hz, will be unimportant in the case of small arms, the octave 300-600 Hz is used in the example.

Where close engagement (15m or less) takes place on ranges with granulated rubber RAU should be aware that if the granulate is exposed it could absorb unburnt propellant that will increase the risk of fire. 02103. Noise. It is MOD policy that all those exposed to weapon noise must wear suitable hearing protection. There is a requirement to reduce noise levels further by applying additional control measures. Such control measures generally take the following two forms: a. Noise Containment. The building fabric, doors, ducting etc, are designed to reduce transmitting noise to the outside environment and to the surrounding structure. Dense materials should be selected for the building fabric of the firing points and bullet catcher chambers. Doors, ducts and other openings can be specified to give a similar level of noise insulation. See also Chapter 31. b. Noise Attenuation. The nature and treatment of internal surfaces are selected to attenuate reflected noise (reverberation) but these measures will not reduce the initial high level of noise produced by the weapon. There are many materials available, such as wood, wool slab, rockwool and glass fibre, which are very effective in reducing reflected noise. However, these materials will also harbour lead dust and unburnt propellant, and are difficult or impossible to clean as the fibrous materials are susceptible to damage""  '

The excavation of a ricochet pit enabled the height of the stop butt wall to be reduced; the reduction was equal to the depth of the pit but the wall height was not to be lower than 6.065 m. d. Compliance. The above is only valid for ranges that comply in all ballistic respects to the Standard Detail. In all other cases compliance is checked against Chapter 5. 0912. Bullet Catcher. A sand or granulated rubber bullet catcher is built over the entire central section of the stop butt wall. Its height is maintained at 2.3 m from the top of the target trench. The bullet catcher is built in the same way as that for the 25 m barrack range (see Chapter 8). 0913. Canopy. The canopy mentioned at paragraph 0906a should be added to all 25m barrack ranges. Otherwise a LDA is required in order to fire 7.62 mm and other high velocity ammunition that does not break up. The LDA has to extend laterally 100 m from each flank target, striking an arc to a line 100 m behind the stop butt in order to capture predicted pop-over. Without a canopy the range is classed as LDA (see Chapter 2). The facing edges of the canopy wing walls are to be protected with timber to prevent backsplash. 0914. Targets. The range may be used with all in-service figure and screen targets, including harmonisation, for SA (see Chapter 29). It is essential to the safety of this range that the target centre design height is maintained. Particular care is necessary when mounting harmonisation screens which must be located in sockets set lower down the mantlet. Where CQM shoots are authorised the RAU is to ensure all possible MPI falls within the bullet trap. The worst case practice will be CQM LFMT 3 m kneeling or squatting position.

The range, which has a flat range floor, should not be confused with the 1908 designed 30 yard Barrack Range which has been metricated. The 1908 design has limitations which do not apply to this range. This range may be distinguished by it’s cantilevered back wall. 0802. Aim.

The target centre should generally correspond to the height of the weapon to achieve a near level line of fire, although there are circumstances which may demand either elevated or depressed lines of fire. Typical target centre heights of between 450mm (T) lowest and 1500mm (T) highest are recommended. Standard details are provided in subsequent chapters. (2) Target Spacing. The target centre spacing should generally correspond to the spacing of the firers although converging lines of fire are acceptable. Typical spacing may be as close as 600mm (T) from centre to centre with the usual maximum spacing being parallel to the firer spacing (diverging lines of fire are not normally used as this would increase the size and cost of protective structures and danger areas). (3) Multi Point Targets & Target Screens. Multi point targets are mainly used only on 0.22"" and air pellet ranges. Target screens are often used on outdoor 1908 barrack ranges. Where such targets are used the minimum defence structure dimensions provided in Table 6 are applied from the centre of the target for those authorised targets illustrated in Chapter 29 and from the highest or flank point of aim as illustrated in Figure 5 for other multi point targets.

It is necessary to establish whether the unit/establishment might cause a nuisance to neighbours by checking noise, odours and other emissions near the boundary of the site during different operating conditions and at different times of the day. • Even if a complaint does not amount to a statutory nuisance considerations should be given to simple practical measures that can be done to remove sources of potential complaint from the surrounding community. • Consider where noisy operations are undertaken in relation to site boundaries and relocate them if possible, perhaps further away, or make use of existing buildings/stockpiles/topography as noise barriers. • Consider replacing noisy equipment and take account of noise emissions when buying new or replacement equipment. 15 Responsibilities of the Job Holder and Contractors working on behalf of the MOD shall ensure that: • All reasonable steps are taken to prevent or minimise a nuisance or potential statutory nuisance. • They are competent to carry out their duties and are appropriately trained. • Reduce noise levels outside buildings by keeping doors and windows closed wherever possible. • Abatement equipment, such as filters and cyclones are kept in good working order.

The main statutes are listed below: Control of Pollution Act 1974 (COPA 1974) The COPA 1974, was largely repealed by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA 1990). However, those sections that remain extant are: • s.60 gives local authorities wide powers in the control of noise from building sites, defining construction widely to include demolition and other engineering operations associated with construction. • s.61 a builder can apply to a local authority prior to commencing construction for consent for noise creation, normally at the same time as application for a building warrant is made, and the authority must grant such a consent if it does not anticipate a noise nuisance will be created. • s.62 deals with noise in built up areas and the noise from loudspeakers in the streets. This Act also introduced the concept of the Noise Abatement Zone (NAZ) which provides a more sophisticated means of controlling, and, where justified, reducing noise from commercial and industrial premises, particularly in areas of mixed development. Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA 1990) Under s79 of the EPA 1990, there is a duty on every local authority to inspect its area at appropriate intervals to detect any statutory nuisances that ought to be dealt with. Where a member of the public makes a complaint of a statutory nuisance to the local authority, the authority has to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to investigate the nuisance. If the Environmental Health Officer assesses that a statutory nuisance exists or is likely to occur, the local authority is duty bound to serve an abatement notice. Such a notice can: • require you to abate the nuisance (i.e. to lessen or reduce the nuisance) • prohibit or restrict the nuisance • require you to carry out works or other steps to abate, restrict or remove the nuisance Enforcement may not always come through the regulatory bodies. Members of the public can also take legal action against the MOD under the same section of the Act""  '

0,,,,,,,Which organisations regulate the MOD's environmental protection obligations?,"According to the provided reference text, both statutory regulators and Defence regulators regulate the MOD's environmental protection obligations. The four main statutory regulators for environmental protection in the UK are the Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Natural Resources Wales, and Northern Ireland Environment Agency (JSP 418 Part 1.pdf, page 15). Defence regulators provide regulations and guidance on environmental protection for defence activities where it is a Departmental responsibility (JSP 418 Part 1.pdf, page 9). These Defence regulators are empowered by the Secretary of State or Director DSEA and operate regimes that are aligned with statutory equivalents or near equivalents (JSP 418 Part 1.pdf, page 9).

Most Defence activities in the UK are fully subject to the requirements of environmental protection legislation and are regulated by statutory regulators. Within the UK territories there are four main statutory regulators for EP, these are: a. Environment Agency b. Scottish Environment Protection Agency c. Natural Resources Wales d. Northern Ireland Environment Agency 2. Further to the four main statutory regulators other organisations also have statutory roles for EP these include: a. Local Authorities b. Marine Management Organisation c. Health & Safety Executive (UK Competent Authority for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation & Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation) d. Office of the Nuclear Regulator (ONR) 3. The regimes operated by the statutory regulators are dependent on the legislation that empowers them, and there is variety in those. The Environment Act (1995) established the Environment Agency (EA) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) as regulatory bodies for environmental protection; the Natural Resources Body for Wales (Establishment) Order 2012 established Natural Resources Wales as the environmental protection regulator for Wales. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency was launched in 2008 and is an Executive Agency within the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland. 4. Co-ordinated by Director DSEA the Department maintains Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the EA and the MMO while the Department also has a Radioactive Substances Agreement with SEPA. 5. These agreements help standardise interactions between the statutory regulators and Commanding Officers / Heads of Establishment and the Department as a whole; in certain areas the MoU provides interpretation of the regulators responsibilities in Defence. Defence Regulators 6. Defence regulators provide regulations and guidance of environmental protection for defence activities where there is a Departmental responsibility; this includes where these activities take place outside the UK but with due regard to host nation expectations.

0,,,,,,,What are the assessment critera for grading SFA for the purpose of calculating charges?,"The assessment criteria for grading SFA for the purpose of calculating charges, as outlined in the provided reference text, include condition, scale, and location. Each factor produces an assessment at three incremental levels, leading to nine different charging bands (A-I). The combination of the assessments made for each factor determines the accommodation charging band for individual SFA. The methodology for assessing SFA is detailed in JSP 464 Vol 3, Part 1, Chapter 5 and Annex A.

For condition, a reduction of two bands applies for every drop in category (e.g., from DH+ to DH results in a drop from band 'A' to band 'C'). For scale, a reduction of one band applies for every drop in category (e.g., from Upper to Middle results in a drop from band 'A' to band 'B'). For location, a reduction of one band applies for every drop in category within the location (e.g., from Urban to Intermediate results in a drop from band 'A' to band 'B').

Overseas SFA accommodation charge reductions include a reduction by 2 charging bands of the CAAS Band assessment for all overseas SFA and a CILOCT Waiver, exempting CILOCT charges for SP in SFA or SLA (or substitute equivalents) overseas.

The condition assessment for SFA is based on the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) 'Decent Homes Standard' (DHS), which includes four criteria: meeting the statutory minimum standard for housing, being in a reasonable state of repair, having reasonably modern facilities and services, and having a reasonable degree of thermal comfort. The target standard for SFA is Decent Homes Plus (DH+).

The three categories into which each property will be placed are: Decent Homes Plus (DH+), Decent Homes (DH), and Decent Homes Minus (DH-). The Target standard for SFA is DH+.

The assessment of condition, scale and location factors (as described in Vol 3, Part 1, Chapter 5 and detailed at Chapters 3-5 below) will produce an assessment at 3 incremental levels for each factor. This leads to 9 different changing bands (A-I). The combination of the three-level assessments made for each factor will determine the accommodation charging band for individual SFA. The methodology for assessing SFA is provided at Annex A and described as follows: a. Starting point. The start of the banding (top charge – band A) is set at Decent Homes Plus (DH+) for condition, upper scale and urban location, with a discount for those properties that do not meet the top standard; b. Condition. Reduce by two bands for every drop in category for condition (i.e. if a property is in ‘DH’ rather than ‘DH+’ it will drop from band ‘A’ to band ‘C’); c. Scale. Reduce by one band for every drop in category for scale (i.e. if a property is ‘Middle’ rather than ‘Upper’ it will drop from band ‘A’ to band ‘B’); d. Location. Reduce by one band for every drop in category within location (i.e. if a property is ‘Intermediate’ rather than ‘Urban’ it will drop from band ‘A’ to band ‘B’); e. Combination of Condition, Scale or Location reductions. Where a combination of these factors apply, e.g. using all the examples above, if the property is ‘DH’, ‘Middle’ and ‘Intermediate’ it will drop 2+1+1 = 4 Bands, i.e. from Band ‘A’ to Band ‘E’ in accordance with the Table below: 0102.

To explain the transition policy for the introduction of CAAS from Apr 16 and to set out the specific transitional arrangements that will apply for the assessment and administration of charges. Scope 0702. This Section applies to all UK and overseas SFA. General 0703. The New Employment Model directed a reform of the accommodation charging system by MOD. The Combined Accommodation Assessment System (CAAS) was introduced in Apr 16. The system was designed to be objective, transparent and independent. CAAS ensures accommodation charges for SFA are adjusted accordingly against national civilian standards. The maximum charge level is recommended by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) annually. 0704. In developing CAAS, the opportunity was taken to harmonise the level of discount between all property types. The new methodology will also place greater weighting on the condition of properties, to reflect Service Personnel preferences, and to incentivise continued investment in the standard of accommodation. Because of the differential in the percentage discount between property types there is no direct correlation with 4TG (except between Grade 1 and Band A unfurnished). 0705. The transfer and transitional arrangements are set out in Para 0707 and 0708 below. Specific transitional rules are set out in Annex A to this Chapter. 0706. When CAAS was introduced previous under-grading of properties through the using of the 4TG system was rectified. In recognition of the financial strain this would place on SP charge rises were staggered; endorsement was given to increases charges by one charging band each year from Apr 17 and annually thereafter until the property charge reaches the final CAAS band. 0707. The final CAAS band of that property, as stated in para 0706, is specific to the house and this band will be then applied to the SP occupying that house at the time.

An investment appraisal serves three main purposes: providing the responsible manager with necessary information for sound decision-making, supporting approval processes, and serving as a record for future reviews or audits. The appraisal process involves setting clear objectives, considering all options including in-house ones, undertaking risk assessments, and achieving the best value for money outcome within available funding (JSP 507 Part 1, pages 35-36). Decisions are based on sound and thorough appraisals to protect the position of the Accounting Officer, who is answerable to Parliament for the efficient and effective use of MOD resources (JSP 507 Part 1, page 8)","['This passage is from JSP 507 Part 1.pdf, page 37: ""a. the remaining period the equipment is expected to remain in service; b. the planned future utilisation of the main equipment and how this differs from past experience; c. spares consumption or Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rates; d. current levels of free stock; e. stock return trends. 33. Where there are any other significant factors to be considered, such as potential alternative suppliers or innovative support packages, an appraisal must be undertaken. Business Improvement Policy 34. The overriding objective is to provide defence outputs offering best value for money affordable to the taxpayer. As part of the process of ensuring a fair comparison can be made between the true costs and risks of undertaking activities commercially and those of retaining activities in-house an investment appraisal must be produced. 35. In reviewing activities, there is a need to: a. set clear objectives; b. ensure that the scope is fully defined and robust; c. consider the full range of options to meet the requirement including in-house options; d. undertake a fully detailed risk assessment; e. achieve the best value for money outcome within available funding. 36. The scoping and feasibility stages of each review will determine the eventual means of securing improvement. In determining the appropriate scope, consideration should be given to the potential impact on MOD employees inside and outside the project boundary. Whatever the eventual outcome, the review process is likely to result in new ways of delivering services and TUs will need to be involved. Management must keep the TUs fully informed and consult with them as appropriate and at the appropriate level. The process must be as transparent as possible recognising commercial sensitivities, to ensure that Trade Unions and staff understand how an objective decision will be reached. It should be borne in mind that MOD policy for interaction with TU’s is clearly set out in the Employee Relations Policy located in the People Services pages of the Defence Intranet and any failure to adhere to its direction is likely to delay, rather than expedite the project. 37""  '

PUS, as Principal Accounting Officer, is answerable to Parliament, through the Secretary of State for Defence, for the efficient and effective use of MOD resources, and appears before the Public Accounts Committee to answer for the use of MOD resources. If decisions can be shown to be based on sound and thorough appraisals, and are properly evaluated, then the position of the Accounting Officer is protected. The Purpose of Appraisal 5. An investment appraisal serves three main purposes. a. Its prime function is to give the responsible manager the information he or she needs to make a sound decision. As such, appraisal is an essential part of the search for best value for money. b. When a decision is outside the manager’s delegated authority, then an appraisal will need to be presented as part of a submission for approval, and will form an important part of the case for gaining approval. A thorough appraisal that is well documented and presented will help to demonstrate that the project is soundly based and will smooth the process of gaining approval. c. The appraisal also provides a record of what was expected to be achieved by the project and the factors on which the decision was based. It will be an important starting point for any later review or audit of the project, and in particular for project evaluation. 6. The aim is not to reduce decision taking to mere mechanics, but rather to place it on a rational and informed basis in which decisions are taken with a clear understanding of the costs and benefits of the available options. Value for Money 7. In pursuing policy objectives, the objective of all public sector bodies is to achieve Value for Money (VfM) defined as optimising net social costs and benefits. The assessment of value is based upon the interests of society as a whole rather than to MOD or the public sector alone (see Part 2, Chapter 5, paragraph 27). VfM can be defined as the optimal combination of: a. Economy – i.e. Cost of Inputs (I/M : Inputs/Money) b. Efficiency – i.e. Ratio of Output to Inputs (O/I : Outputs/Inputs c. Effectiveness – i.e. Value of Outcomes from Outputs (V/O : Value/Outputs) Hence VfM = I/M x O/I x V/O = V/M (Value / Money) 8""  '

This can be done by adjusting for optimism bias using techniques such as three-point estimates and sensitivity analysis (JSP 507 Part 2, pages 103-110). The text also suggests that a ""sanity check"" of risk should be performed to compare the optimism bias adjusted cost with the existing calculation of confidence figures, which can help ensure that insufficient consideration has not been given to an aspect of risk (JSP 507 Part 2, page 110).

Risk management; c. Risk register; d. Risk mitigation; e. Quantifying risk; f. Three point estimates; g. Monte Carlo analysis; h. Sensitivity analysis. Introduction 1. There is always likely to be some difference between what is expected, as reflected in an appraisal, and what eventually happens. This is due to biases inherent in the appraisal, and risks and uncertainties that materialise. As a result, risk management strategies should be adopted for the appraisal and implementation of all policies, programmes or projects. 2. An appraisal should take proportionate account of risks and uncertainties in the estimates of costs and benefits. The components of an appraisal should be presented in a way that allows the most important risks and uncertainties to be readily appreciated. It can sometimes be helpful to quote the value that a key quantity would have to take to alter the ranking of options. Appraisal should also assess the risks and uncertainties associated with factors that have not been valued in monetary terms. Definitions 3. In the context of appraisals, the following definitions are usually applied: a. Risk: An event which may or may not occur, where the probability of occurrence and financial impact are susceptible to measurement. b. Uncertainty: An event that will occur, which has more than one possible outcome. Optimism Bias 4. Optimism bias is the demonstrated, systematic tendency to be overly optimistic about key project parameters. There is a demonstrated tendency for projects to overstate benefits, and underestimate timings and costs. 5. To redress this tendency, explicit allowance for this bias should be made in all projects for which it is applicable (see paragraph 9), regardless of their size or complexity. Adjusting for optimism should provide a better estimate, earlier on, of key project parameters. Application of optimism bias is designed to complement and encourage, rather than replace, the practice of calculating project specific risk adjustments. It is also designed to encourage more accurate costing. Accordingly, adjustments for optimism may""  '

The resulting figure should equate to the expected value or “mean” cost estimate. If the optimism bias adjusted cost is close to the “mean” cost estimate, no further investigation is required. 26. If the optimism bias adjusted figure is close to, or exceeds, the 90% cost estimate, this should not be ignored. The 90% cost estimate should be reviewed, as the implication of the “sanity check” is that insufficient consideration has been given to an aspect of risk. Example The confidence estimates of capital expenditure for a standard buildings project are as follows: 10% £130M 50% £146M 90% £158M The most likely estimate of cost is £145M. The mitigated optimism bias percentage to be applied to the capital expenditure has been estimated as 3.9%. The forecast capital expenditure for this example, taking into account optimism bias, is £151M, which is calculated as follows: £145M + (3.9% x £145M) = £151M 1 0 % £ 1 3 0 M £ 1 5 8 M C O S T  5 0 9 0 £ 1 4 6 M M o s t lik e ly e stim a te a n d O B = £ 1 5 1 M £ 1 5 1 M  3 .9 % £ 1 4 5 M 27. However, it does not mean that the 90% estimate is necessarily wrong. As long as both the original risk assessment and the optimism bias adjustment have been reviewed, and the outcome documented, the comparison of the optimism bias adjusted figure to the 90% cost estimate should not be viewed as a pass or fail test. It is not always sensible or required for the 90% cost estimate to exceed the more crudely estimated optimism bias adjusted cost.""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 107: ""13. To calculate the appropriate upper bound values for combined projects the following approach is recommended: a. Determine the percentage split for each identified project type (use best judgment). b. Identify the upper bound values for each project type. c. Multiply each percentage of capital expenditure by the appropriate upper bound optimism bias. d. Add the optimism bias contributions together to determine the resultant optimism bias percentage. 14. The following table shows a worked example of the calculated resultant upper bound optimism bias level for capital expenditure for a combined building project: Project Type Percentage of CAPEX (%) Upper bound OB (%) OB Contribution (%) Resultant OB (%) Non-standard building 30 51 15.3 (30 x 51.4) - Standard building 70 24 16.8 (70 x 24) - Combined building 100 - - 32.1 (15.3 + 16.8) 15. As optimism bias factors have only been established for capital costs and works duration, the estimation of optimism bias will not be readily applicable for all projects. 16. Optimism bias should only be applied to new expenditure, rather than to opportunity costs of existing assets. 17. The ‘outsourcing’ category should only be used for options concerned with provision of services by the private sector, such as hard and soft facilities management services, and activities such as equipment maintenance, support, and overhauls. 18. In some circumstances, such as an ongoing in-house service contract, or for MOD training exercises, where there are no capital costs involved, adjustments for optimism bias are not appropriate. Sensitivity analysis should be used in such cases to test the potential impact of optimism on key parameters. Step Two – Always start with the upper bound 19. Use the appropriate upper bound value for optimism bias from Table 1 above as the starting value for calculating the optimism bias level. These upper bound values must always be used, unless robust evidence exists to use a different value. Step Three – Consider whether the optimism bias factor can be reduced 20. The tables at Annex A show the percentage contributions to the upper bound of various factors for each type of project, and for two types of optimism bias – capital costs and works duration.""  '

To retain the support of employers and the ability to mobilise reservists for priority tasks, taking into account that there are limits on the duration of permanent service within set periods, reservists should not routinely be mobilised solely to conduct training, professional / personal development activities, or provide training support which is not directly related to operations. Such activities should be undertaken under Sections 22, 24, 25 or 27 of RFA 96. However, mobilisation for DAOTO may require employment in support of training activity to achieve Defence strategic objectives. It is likely that restrictions would be removed in the event of national emergency or warfighting operations, directed within Sections 52 and 54 of RFA 96 respectively. The Mobilisation Process 13. The generic mobilisation process is shown diagrammatically at Figure 1 and described below10: a. Statement of Requirement. SCs are responsible for force generation within their respective Service and deciding on whether there is a requirement to mobilise reservists for an operation or task. This will normally be established following a review of the operational Statement of Requirement (SOR) or CDS Directive which will detail the capabilities required for any task. b. Call-Out / Recall Order. A call-out order provides legal authority to mobilise reservists. A recall order provides lawful authority to mobilise persons liable to recall. A call-out order is not required to mobilise High Readiness Reserves (HRR) or Sponsored Reserves (SR).

 'This passage is from JSP 753 Part 1.pdf, page 4: ""1 General Conditions Introduction 1. Reserve Forces provide an integral component of the UK Defence capability, as part of the Whole Force1. Provision is made with respect to the Reserve Forces by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96), as amended by the Armed Forces Act 2006 (AFA 06) and the Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14). RFA 96 provides for the call-out and recall of Reserve Forces for permanent service. This process is also referred to as ‘mobilisation’ and serves as the primary mechanism for reservists to undertake military operations or other authorised military tasks. 2. For the purposes of this JSP, mobilisation is the process by which an individual reservist, or group of reservists, is brought into permanent service. Failure to attend for service on call-out without leave lawfully granted or a reasonable justification is an offence under RFA 96. However, reservists and employers have the right to apply for deferral of, or exemption from, a reservist’s liability to be mobilised or, in the case of persons already serving, release or discharge from service. RFA 96 limits the periods for which reservists may be required to serve when mobilised. Once brought into permanent service, reservists attract many of the same rights and benefits as their Regular counterparts. In addition, their civilian employment rights are protected and both the employer and reservist may be entitled to claim financial assistance. 3. The Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14) amended RFA 96 to allow the Secretary of State (SofS) for Defence to authorise the mobilisation of Reserve Forces if it appears to the Secretary of State that it is necessary or desirable to use reservists for any purpose for which members of the Regular services may be used2. This amendment significantly broadened the circumstances in which reservists could be mobilised. The intent of DRA 14, as a key component of the Future Reserves 2020 programme, was to enable reservists to be effectively integrated within the Whole Force, making a valuable, flexible and sustainable contribution to Defence capability.

Research should normally commence within 12 months of the date on which a favourable ethics opinion is given by MODREC. A study is generally considered to have commenced when any of the procedures set out in the protocol are initiated. 2. If the study not commence within 12 months the Chief Investigator (CI) must give MODREC a written explanation for the delay. 3. If the project not commence within 24 months a further explanation must be given and a decision will be taken by the MODREC chair as to whether the project must require re-review before commencing. 4. If a study is abandoned prior to commencement, the CI or Research Sponsor must notify MODREC by letter, giving reasons. It is not necessary to submit the form for declaring the conclusion or early termination of the study. If a study is abandoned and it is later proposed to start it afresh, a new application must be made. Monitoring of research given a favourable opinion 5. Under the Clinical Trials Regulations, the Research Sponsor of a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product has a variety of statutory responsibilities for notifying the relevant REC of developments in the research after it has started. These are outlined in the HRA SOPs, and must be adhered to if MODREC is the relevant REC. 6. For other types of studies MODREC must keep under review the favourable ethics opinion given to any research study in the light of progress reports and significant developments in the research. 7. Other than by means of the reports that the Research Sponsor and investigators are required to submit, MODREC has no responsibility for proactive monitoring of research studies.

Confirmation of management permission or approval from relevant organisation(s) to proceed with the research also needs to be in place. The various responsibilities in relation to carrying out the research are described in JSP 536 Part 1 Chapter 3. Duration of a favourable ethics opinion 31. MODRECs favourable ethics opinion for a specific research study applies for the duration of the study, except where action is taken to suspend or terminate the opinion. Extension of the study period represents a substantial amendment. If the research is open ended a review (initially by a MODREC sub-committee) must be conducted every five years. 32. It must be noted that continuation of the ethics opinion only applies to the study as described in the application, the protocol and any amendments made by the Research Sponsor.

1. Protect the frozen tissue from further damage by ensuring the skin is dry and removing any jewelry from the affected body part. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, pages 18-19)
2. Make a decision whether to thaw the tissue or keep it frozen based on environmental conditions and the risk of refreezing. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, page 19)
   a. If rapid rewarming is not possible or the frozen part has the potential to refreeze, allow spontaneous or passive thawing. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, pages 19-20)
   b. If definitive care is more than 2 hours away and it's safe to do so, perform field rewarming by immersing the affected limb in circulating water heated between 37-39°C. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, page 19)
3. Administer ibuprofen (400-800mg TDS) if available. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, pages 19, 20, and 31)
4. Treat hypothermia if present and ensure appropriate hydration. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, page 31)
5. Protect the frozen tissue from refreezing and direct trauma. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, pages 19-20)
6. Document the injury with photographs as soon as possible after the incident. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, page 33)
7. Avoid ambulation on thawed lower extremities unless only distal toes are affected. (JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, page 31)

Additionally, the reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex B.pdf suggests gently warming the casualty and providing warm food and drink if they are wet and cold. (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex B.pdf, page 6) However, it is important to note that artificial heat, hot water, or stoves should not be used as they can make the injury worse.

If available, ibuprofen (400-800mg TDS) should be started in the field. 31.  Specific recommendations Scenario 1. Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 1 include the following:  a.  Dressings. Apply if it is practical to do so and will not interfere with mobility. Dressings should be applied to the frozen part and between the toes and fingers.  b.  Ambulation and protection. If at all possible, a frozen extremity should not be used for walking, climbing or other maneuvers until definitive care is reached. If using the frozen extremity for mobility is considered, a risk-benefit analysis should consider the potential for further trauma and possible poorer outcomes. Although it is reasonable to walk on a foot with frostbitten toes for evacuation purposes, it is inadvisable to walk  on an entirely frostbitten foot because of the potential for resulting morbidity. If using a frozen extremity for locomotion or evacuation is unavoidable, the extremity should be padded, splinted, and kept as immobile as possible to minimize additional trauma. Measures should be taken to protect frozen tissue to prevent further trauma. 32.  Specific recommendations Scenario 2. Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 2 include the following:  a.  Rapid field rewarming of frostbite. Field rewarming by warm water bath immersion can and should be performed if the proper equipment and methods are available and definitive care is more than 2 hours away. Field rewarming should only be undertaken if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until the patient arrives at definitive care. (1)  Water should be heated to between 37-39°C. If a thermometer is not available, a safe water temperature can be determined by placing an uninjured  hand in the water for at least 30 seconds to confirm that the water temperature is tolerable and will not cause burn injury.  (2)  The affected limb should be suspended in circulating water. Because the water may cool after the rewarming process is started, the water should be continually, but carefully, warmed to the target temperature.  (3)""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, page 18: ""Field treatment. If a body part is frozen in the field, the frozen tissue should be protected from further damage. Ensure the skin is dry. Remove jewellery from the body part. Do not rub tissue in an attempt to re-warm.  27.  Refreezing injury. A decision should be made whether or not to thaw the tissue. If environmental conditions are such that thawed tissue could refreeze, it is safer to keep the affected part frozen until a thawed state can be maintained. You must avoid refreezing if field-thawing occurs.  28.  Antibiotics.  All cases in which there is a significant amount of dying or dead tissue  should be considered for systemic antibiotics and anti-tetanus prophylaxis. Anyone with  damaged or contaminated areas of frostbite, e.g., frostbite complicating a gunshot wound,  should be started on antibiotics and have anti-tetanus immediately (using an appropriate  antibiotic protocol) and transferred to hospital for specialist care. When FCI is severe, the risks of anaerobic infection are significant, and gas gangrene and tetanus have killed many of  those with the worst cold injuries in the past.  29.  Spontaneous or passive thawing. Most frostbite will thaw spontaneously and should be allowed to do so if rapid rewarming cannot be readily achieved. Strategies for 2 scenarios are presented:  a.  Scenario 1. The frozen part has the potential of refreezing and will not be actively thawed.  b.  Scenario 2. The frozen part can be kept thawed and warm with minimal risk of refreezing until evacuation is completed.  30.  Therapeutic options for both Scenarios 1 and 2.  a.  Treatment of hypothermia. Hypothermia frequently accompanies frostbite. HTI (hypothermia staging) may be treated concurrently with the frostbite injury. HTII-IV  should be treated effectively before treating the frostbite injury. b.  Hydration. Appropriate hydration is important in frostbite recovery and fluids should be administered if possible. Oral fluids should be given if the patient is alert. If the patient is nauseated, vomiting or has an altered mental status, warmed IV fluids  should be given if available. c.  Ibuprofen.

The requirements set out here are separate from, and additional to, the specific communications requirements on Duty Holders to provide timely notification of an OSNE including, where appropriate, public safety advice.   The MOD, as the LGD in the event of a Defence Nuclear Emergency, must have a clear communications strategy to ensure the effective and efficient management of the departmental and Central Government communications issues.  Responsibility for the overall effectiveness of MOD’s media and communications response lies with the Directorate of Defence Communications (DDC).  HQ DNEO is responsible for ensuring that information for the public, parliament and the media is accurate, consistent, informative and issued promptly.  The need for public safety and reassurance takes precedence over security requirements, although any relaxation of security requirements should only be considered where there is a demonstrable conflict between safety and security requirements, and this decision should be informed by the appropriate MOD authorities.  This will include SDA-DNSR and SPO-DefNucSyR.   In so far as is practicable press statements are to be pre-prepared covering the immediate phase of the response.  These statements are to allow for the inclusion of specific details relating to the location of the emergency and casualties.  Background material is to be prepared covering topics which are likely to be required to be briefed in depth to the media.  For example details about the operation, the nuclear asset, radiation and radioactive materials and medical aspects.  Consideration should be given as to how this will be published i.e. the printed press or on the internet.  Photographs or short film clips may be required.

All safety concerns on the Defence estate and any required actions must be communicated to the relevant stakeholders (for example users or maintainers) in a timely manner as identified in the Defence organisation’s communications plan.

Telephone number: 01554 822368  Facsimilie number: 01554 822350 Original  Foreword  By the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Permanent under  Secretary, Ministry of Defence  Law, both domestic and international, plays an increasingly important part  in Defence activities these days. When undertaking operations, Com-  manders must take into account a broad and increasingly complex body of  operational law. The Law of Armed Conflict is a part of that wider body of  applicable law, but it merits a manual in its own right because of its great  importance to all those involved in the use of force and in wider military  activities.  This is the first major statement of the British approach to the Law of  Armed Conflict since 1958. During the intervening years, there have been  numerous expressions of the UK’s position on aspects of this law, but noth-  ing as comprehensive as this Manual. In this fast moving world, some  issues cannot of necessity be stated in absolute terms. What follows is, how-  ever, a clear articulation of the UK’s approach to the Law of Armed Conflict.  In the same fast moving world, the law itself evolves, and to that end this  publication will be subject to periodic revision, the resulting amendments  being published as noted in the Preface.  The United Kingdom has long appreciated the practical, policy and legal  importance of conducting the full range of its military activities in accor-  dance with applicable legal norms. The publication of this Manual should  be seen as another step in stating publicly the UK’s interpretation of what  the Law of Armed Conflict requires. This Manual will form the basis for  training of UK military personnel in this body of law, and will be used  widely to inform practical decision making.  CDS PUS  Original  Preface  Background and Acknowledgements  This Manual is a reference work for members of the United Kingdom’s  Armed Forces and officials within the Ministry of Defence and other  departments of Her Majesty’s Government.

INVOLSEP refers to Service personnel who are separated from their immediate family, normally for Service reasons, and are eligible for benefits related to unaccompanied service under various circumstances such as assignments of 12 months or less, being assigned to a different location from their spouse/civil partner in excess of 50 miles apart, waiting to occupy Service Families Accommodation (SFA), or attending a course as a student for periods up to 12 months.

VOLSEP, on the other hand, refers to Service personnel who are not separated from their immediate family for Service reasons and are not eligible for benefits related to unaccompanied service. This status may apply when a Service person makes a conscious decision to serve unaccompanied or when they are unable to return to their permanent duty station on stand down and weekends after being temporarily detached for 7 days or more.

Therefore, the main difference between VOLSEP and INVOLSEP is that INVOLSEP status is granted to Service personnel who are separated from their families due to Service reasons, while VOLSEP status is given to those who choose to serve unaccompanied or are unable to return to their permanent duty station for other reasons.

Additionally, reservists and employers may also apply for release or discharge from service (JSP 753 Part 1.pdf, page 4, paragraph 1). Therefore, a reservist can refuse mobilisation by applying for deferral, exemption, release, or discharge in accordance with the laws and regulations outlined in RFA 96, AFA 06, and DRA 14.

Reserve Forces provide an integral component of the UK Defence capability, as part of the Whole Force1. Provision is made with respect to the Reserve Forces by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96), as amended by the Armed Forces Act 2006 (AFA 06) and the Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14). RFA 96 provides for the call-out and recall of Reserve Forces for permanent service. This process is also referred to as ‘mobilisation’ and serves as the primary mechanism for reservists to undertake military operations or other authorised military tasks. 2. For the purposes of this JSP, mobilisation is the process by which an individual reservist, or group of reservists, is brought into permanent service. Failure to attend for service on call-out without leave lawfully granted or a reasonable justification is an offence under RFA 96. However, reservists and employers have the right to apply for deferral of, or exemption from, a reservist’s liability to be mobilised or, in the case of persons already serving, release or discharge from service. RFA 96 limits the periods for which reservists may be required to serve when mobilised. Once brought into permanent service, reservists attract many of the same rights and benefits as their Regular counterparts. In addition, their civilian employment rights are protected and both the employer and reservist may be entitled to claim financial assistance. 3. The Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14) amended RFA 96 to allow the Secretary of State (SofS) for Defence to authorise the mobilisation of Reserve Forces if it appears to the Secretary of State that it is necessary or desirable to use reservists for any purpose for which members of the Regular services may be used2. This amendment significantly broadened the circumstances in which reservists could be mobilised. The intent of DRA 14, as a key component of the Future Reserves 2020 programme, was to enable reservists to be effectively integrated within the Whole Force, making a valuable, flexible and sustainable contribution to Defence capability.

However, if the civilian employment is also with the MOD, it is inappropriate for the MOD to pay the same individual twice for their working time. (JSP 534 Part 2.odt, page 0, QRs for the Army 1975 AC 13206 - Amendment no 37 para 5.079d)

Additionally, you can attend employment fairs during leave or at your CO's discretion, but attendance will count against your GRT if a GRT travel warrant is used and your GRT has not been exhausted. (JSP 534 Part 2.odt, page 0)

During maternity leave in the Royal Navy, SMP (and therefore Occupational Pay) will stop if you work for an employer who did not employ you during the qualifying week, but working in a self-employed capacity during the MPP will not affect the payment of SMP. It is your responsibility to inform your releasing unit should you take up civilian employment whilst in receipt of SMP. (JSP 760 Part 1.pdf, page 138)

It is not believed that anyone within the scope of the AFPS 05 GOTT is in this category. 1122. Providing the former active member’s condition falls into Tier 2 or 3 (as described in Part 1 paras 0319 and 0312 of this JSP) they will receive a pension based on their reckonable service adjusted by the Scheme Actuary in accordance with paras 1116 or 1118 above plus any adjustment in accordance with Part 1, paras 0319 and 0312 of this JSP. This means that, if the former active member left with a condition which falls into Tier 2 or 3, his reckonable service will be enhanced in respect of the relevant proportion of prospective service to age 55. 1123.

Under the AFPS 197519, the death in service lump sum paid20 is equal to three times the individual’s final salary, whereas under the AFPS 200521 and AFPS 201522 the lump sum is equal to four times the individual’s final salary. 4.32. The amount paid as BG also depends on whether the death occurs during or after service. This is due to the differing pension benefits paid through the AFPS depending on whether the death occurs during or after service. 4.33. The BG was developed as a part of the AFCS to recognise that where an individual dies as a result of service, their partner and/or child(ren) should not receive a lower lump sum than they may have done if the deceased had been a member of AFPS 2005 or AFPS 2015. As a result, depending on the pension scheme that the person was a member of, and whether the death occurs during or after service, their pension lump sum is enhanced where appropriate by payment of a BG. 4.34. Where an individual dies in service one of the following amounts are payable: • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 75 only, their dependant(s) will receive a BG of £25,000. • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 05 only or AFPS 15 (including those who have accrued rights to AFPS 75 or 05) and their salary at the date of death was less than £25,000, their dependant(s) will receive the difference between their salary and the BG amount, for example if their salary was £16,000 per annum, their dependants will receive a payment of £9,000. If their salary at date of death was above £25,000 then no BG is payable. 4.35. If the death occurs after the individual has left service, the BG is paid regardless of the pension scheme of the deceased. The amount payable is one and a half times the base level of BG in order to compensate for the smaller lump sum that is payable from the member’s pension scheme where death occurs after service – so the BG payable in these circumstances is £37,500. 4.36. Separate provisions apply for Reservists (see Chapter 7). 19 Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975. 20 From 1 April 2022, all active service personnel are members of AFPS 15.

1. If a person has only completed service, the compensation is calculated as one-eighth of the FRE for each year of completed service (JSP 764 Part 5.pdf, para 0315).
2. If a person has both completed and uncompleted service, the compensation is the lower value between:

Additionally, people made redundant may be entitled to other benefits such as a preserved pension and pension lump sum when they reach retirement age, depending on their qualifying service (JSP 764 Part 5.pdf, para 0317).

A Special Capital Payment (SCP) or Compensation Lump Sum (CLS) will be awarded under DER arrangements if the relevant Service is able to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of suitable employment becoming available for the officer within a reasonable timescale and it can be shown that the lack of availability of further employment is related to: (a) the removal or regrading of a post after an individual has taken up the post or has been notified of appointment to it1, which could not have been foreseen or prevented at the time of appointment, and (b) an unplanned reduction in the number of posts available to the Service (including potential joint appointments) which the officer was qualified to fill and which was caused by restructuring or changes in employment requirements within the Service or the Department or external employing organisation e.g. NATO, UN.

In most circumstances, a claim form must be completed before a decision can be made on whether compensation is payable. The claim must be made in writing to Armed Forces and Veterans Services within the time limit – see paragraphs 5.4 to 5.11 for more information on what this means. 5.2. AFCS claim forms can be accessed at the following gov.uk link: Armed Forces Compensation Scheme - How to make a claim. Individuals can also claim by filling in a paper claim form by calling the DBS Helpline on 0808 1914 218 Mon to Fri 8am to 4pm or email veterans-uk@mod.gov.uk. The helpline will send you a form and a pre-paid envelope to return it. 5.3. There are two circumstances where an AFCS award will be considered automatically without the need for a claim form. These are: • When an individual is medically discharged, and has been considered eligible for an ill-health pension, DBS will automatically consider the principal medical condition leading to medical discharge to determine whether it is caused by service and therefore warrants an AFCS award. This will not happen if the individual already has an AFCS award for that condition or made an unsuccessful claim for an AFCS award for that condition. If a claim made during service for the principal condition was rejected as not service caused, DBS will automatically consider whether service has worsened that condition if the individual is eligible for an ill health pension. • If DBS decide not to make an AFCS award for the injury listed as the principal medical condition leading to medical discharge because the injury is not considered to be caused by service, DBS will go on to consider whether the condition is a pre-existing or non-service related injury that has been worsened by service, for which an AFCS award may be made. • When an individual dies whilst in service and leaves an eligible partner and/or eligible child(ren), subject to paragraphs 4.12 to 4.13, bereavement compensation will automatically be considered by DBS.

 'This passage is from JSP 765.pdf, page 4: ""Chapter 2 - Eligibility Entitlement 2.1. Awards under the WPS are based on causation. Individuals may be entitled to a payment if they suffer injury wholly or partly as a result of their service in the Armed Forces. Payment under the WPS is not restricted to those injured during operations; injuries incurred during regular peacetime training or on exercise are also covered. 2.2. Awards under the Scheme are made for any disablement, either mental or physical, provided there is a causal link to service. There are no time limits for claiming; however, the test for causal link to service changes after seven years. 2.3. Payments under the WPS can only be made once an individual leaves service; there is no entitlement to payment whilst still in service. 2.4. An individual may be entitled to benefits because of a relationship to an Armed Forces member (i.e., eligible dependant). Also, in certain circumstances some individuals who were not members of the Armed Forces may be eligible to be considered under one of a number of minor schemes which operate on similar lines to the WPS. Details on these schemes can be found at Chapter 8. Burden of Proof 2.5. If a claim is made not later than seven years after the termination of an individual’s service in the Armed Forces and there is a reasonable doubt that disablement is due to or aggravated by service, the benefit of doubt is given to the claimant. 2.6. If a claim is made more than seven years after the termination of an individual’s service in the Armed Forces, the benefit of reasonable doubt is given to the claimant where, upon reliable evidence, a reasonable doubt exists that the disablement is attributable to or aggravated by service. 2.7. The same Burden of Proof applies in the case of the death of the former member of the Armed Forces and a dependant’s claim (see Chapter 4). 2.8.

If a relatively minor injury is sustained as a result of service, it might be that the individual wants to make the claim immediately and move on. However, if the injuries are of a more serious nature and continued medical treatment is required, they may wish to delay their claim until their injuries are more settled and they have established their rehabilitative process. It is important to recognise that while an individual remains in service, they will continue to receive their salary and appropriate support from the Services. Award levels depend on assessing the claimed injury when it is in a treated steady medical state and/or prognosis is reasonably certain. Deferring claims until the ongoing disablement caused by an injury is clearer can, in many cases, be helpful by allowing awards to be made final with appeal rights; however, interim awards may be made (see paragraphs 3.36 to 3.38). 5.6. In some illness cases, the seven-year time limit can be extended for a further three years where the illness first started within the seven-year period but was not diagnosed until less than a year before the end of those seven years, so the individual may not have had sufficient time to make their claim. Illnesses with a Late Onset 5.7. The above time limits do not apply in cases where the illness (including mental health disorder) is medically considered a late-onset illness. In these cases, the time limit is three years from the date of diagnosis, whenever that diagnosis takes place. This provision applies to post-service claims only (i.e., it could be some decades after service has ended). Other Time Limits that Apply 5.8.

Purpose and expectations 2. This element is to assist the Defence organisation to structure, facilitate and encourage flexibility and collaborative working, while managing the associated safety risks and dependencies. This includes: a. Intra-organisation working between Defence organisations, with teams that are formed to best meet delivery requirements and mitigate safety risks rather than aligned with organisational boundaries; and b. Inter-organisational working, such as with other government departments and the supply chain, which brings in experience and expertise from external parties. Safety Management System (SMS) 3. A Safety Management System (SMS) is a formal management system or framework for managing safety. Having this in place can assist in achieving a balance between the systems and behavioural aspects of safety management and it treats safety management as an integral part of good management across the organisation. 4. Defence organisations are to develop and maintain an organisational SMS that reflects their activities and supports the Defence vision for safety and to ensure that there is a consistent approach to safety management. It could be a standalone system or it could be combined with an Environmental Management System (EMS) to become the Defence organisations SEMS. 5. The Defence organisation SMS should set out how the Defence SMS and underpinning policy and regulations will be delivered in a way that is specific to each Defence organisation and is the system by which all Defence organisations conduct and manage the safety aspects of their business activities etc., The Defence organisation’s SMS should set out: a. how the organisation continuously improves its arrangements for managing safety which includes the monitoring of the SMS performance and effectiveness; b""  '

OPCOM refers to the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units, and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as necessary. It is the authority to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned and does not include responsibility for administration or logistics (ADCON).

TACOM, on the other hand, refers to the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. It is the detailed local direction and control of movement or maneuver necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks. TACON (Tactical Control) is different from TACOM as it specifically refers to the detailed local direction and control of movement or maneuver, while TACOM is the broader authority to assign tasks for mission accomplishment.

Therefore, OPCOM involves the delegation of higher-level operational missions and control, while TACOM involves the assignment of specific tactical tasks and control for their execution","['This passage is from JSP 815 Vol 2 Annex A.pdf, page 5: ""b. Operational Control (OPCON). OPCON is the authority delegated to a commander to direct assigned forces so that they may accomplish their specific missions or tasks, usually limited by function, time, or location, to deploy units concerned and to retain or assign tactical control to those units. OPCON allows a commander to issue missions and tasks to subordinates, within the scope of the mission issued by higher authority4. It does not include the authority to assign separate employment of components of the units concerned. Nor does it include administrative or logistic control. c. Tactical Command (TACOM). TACOM is the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. d. Tactical Control (TACON). TACON is the detailed local direction and control of movement, or manoeuvre which is necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks. 1-42. Control and Coordination Terms. The following terms may be ascribed independently to operational and tactical command states to delegate elements of authority: a. Administrative Control (ADCON). ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organisations in respect of administrative matters such as personnel management, supply, services and other issues not included in the operational mission of the subordinate or other organisations. Therefore, ADCON is assigned separately to a given command state. b. Logistic Control (LOGCON). LOGCON is the authority to execute logistics functions and activities within the agreed limits of logistic control in accordance with the Transfer of Authority5. c. Coordinating Authority (CA). CA is the authority granted to a commander, or an individual that assigns responsibility to them for the coordination of specific functions, or activities, involving forces of two or more countries, or commands, or two or more services, or two or more forces of the same service.

Establishing a baseline is the starting point for effective performance management and will drive opportunities for the Defence organisation by preventing or reducing avoidable safety occurrences. It is important that once established, the baseline is captured as the original benchmark, from which to assess changes in performance. However, a major change may require a new baseline to be established. The safety baseline will comprise a variety of sources of information including but not exhaustively: a. Results of safety audits, particularly if these are provided independently by specifically commissioned external authorities such as regulators, both statutory and Defence; b. Peer reviews provided by other related organisations or comparative exercises; c. Data from accident and injury reporting, including trends; d.

It allows Defence organisations to check how effectively legislation and Defence safety policy and regulations are being implemented, where the areas are that require improvement and where are the risks to performance. All these can be compared with the safety baseline. However, care should be taken not to report or use ineffective data and MI, which may obscure the key information: Not all information that can be measured needs to be reported. 7""  '

The DSAT process aims to deliver robust, realistic, and challenging training while avoiding the tendency to provide excess training that may result in insufficient funding for other essential areas. The DSAT process is governed by a common process and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated Quality Management System (QMS) to ensure the best possible preparation of personnel for Defense roles. (3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7","['This passage is from JSP 822 Vol 1.pdf, page 20: ""Figure 4: The DSAT Process Generating a Training System 5. Defence requires its people to place themselves in harm’s way to deliver Defence effect. Defence people work in hazardous environments, under stressful conditions whilst conducting activities that carry a high risk to personal safety. Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives. Therefore, a Training System designed using a common process and that is governed and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated QMS, is vital to ensure that Defence people are best equipped to achieve Defence effect.""

0,,,,,,,How can I identify people who are at risk of exertional collapse?,"According to JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf (pages 31-32), individuals who are at risk of exertional collapse may have personal, environmental, or external risk factors. Personal risk factors include dehydration, recent or current illness, recent vaccination, poor baseline conditioning/fitness level, excess body fat, prior poor fitness test performance, prior exercise-related collapse, accumulated fatigue, an underlying cardiac condition, asthma, and sickle cell trait. Environmental and external risk factors include lack of appropriate environmental acclimatisation (including heat, cold, and altitude), exercise at altitude, high ambient temperature and humidity, certain medications, dietary supplements containing stimulants, and peer or command pressure. Immediate actions to take in the event of exertional collapse include stopping the activity, evaluating and administering first aid, administering oxygen if available, hydrating, initiating cooling techniques, ensuring medical follow-up, reviewing others, and informing the chain of command (JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, pages 31-32). Additionally, universal training precautions such as acclimatisation to heat, cold, or altitude; progressive and graduated increase in exercise duration and intensity; hydration; avoiding stimulants, diuretics, energy drinks, antihistamines, decongestants, NSAIDs, opioids, methylphenidate, weight-loss or other performance-enhancing supplements prior to exercise; avoiding alcohol prior to exercise; ensuring work/rest cycles are followed; observing participants for no less than 10 minutes post-exertion; and ensuring medical facilities are available throughout any programmed physical activity can help reduce the risk of exertional collapse (JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, pages 31-32).

An individual who is poorly performing or demonstrates distress during, or immediately after physical exercise, may be at risk of exertional collapse, and potentially even death. Poor performance and distress must be recognised early to enable timely intervention, including immediate cessation of the physical activity for all participants. Priority must be given to treating the individual. A dynamic risk assessment should consider whether others participating in the same activity are also at risk and whether the activity can safely resume. 16. Risk factors associated with exercise-related collapse can be personal, environmental, or external and recognised risk factors are listed below, noting this is not an exhaustive list: a. Personal risk factors include: • Dehydration. • Recent or current illness (include raised temperature). • Recent vaccination (within 24 hours). • Poor baseline conditioning/fitness level. • Excess body fat. • Prior poor fitness test performance. • Prior exercise related collapse. • Accumulated fatigue. • An underlying cardiac condition. • Asthma. • Sickle Cell Trait (SCT). Clinical evidence suggests that these individuals may be more prone to injury (or death) with physical exertion. b. Environmental and external risk factors include: • Lack of appropriate environmental acclimatisation (including heat, cold and altitude). • Exercise at altitude. • High ambient temperature and humidity and cold weather. • Certain medications. • Dietary supplements containing stimulants, including energy shots or drinks. 17.

The activity may be terminated or only restarted once further mitigation measures have been approved, recorded, and applied as per the activity protocols. h. INFORM the chain of command as necessary. UNIVERSAL TRAINING PRECAUTIONS (UTPs) 19. The risk of Exertional Collapse can be reduced through Universal Training Precautions (UTPs). These UTPs should be integrated into the planning, design and conduct of fitness tests or other physical activity. They should also be included in an individual’s own preparation. 20. The UTPs are as follows: a. Acclimatisation to heat, cold or altitude. b. Progressive and graduated increase in exercise duration and intensity. c. Hydration sufficient to maintain clear-light yellow urine. d. Avoid stimulants, diuretics, energy drinks, antihistamines, decongestants, non-  steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, methylphenidate and weight-loss or other performance-enhancing supplements prior to exercise. e. Avoid alcohol prior to exercise. f. Ensure work /rest cycles are followed. g. Observe participants for no less than 10 minutes post exertion. h.

Individuals who enter service or join a new unit, station or ship, with a SpLD that requires some form of employer involvement, should inform their line manager, trainer or commander at the first opportunity; bringing to their attention any previously agreed Learning Support or ILP, for action, where appropriate. SP with SpLD that does not impact their working lives, or who have evolved coping strategies that do not require employer involvement, need not inform their line manager, trainer, or commander; although it may be prudent to do so.

This provision does not exempt civilian pattern livery MOD vehicles from displaying a road fund licence.

Vehicles belonging to Her Majesty’s forces.

A live link direction may be made in relation to any witness, whether as to fact, character or otherwise, and whether the witness is in the country in which the proceedings are being held or otherwise. Where a direction is given that a witness (including a defendant) may attend proceedings by live link, the witness cannot give evidence otherwise than by live link without the leave of the judge advocate34.

Defendant giving evidence during trial. A defendant may make an application to a judge advocate to give evidence at trial through a live link, and a direction may be made if it is in the interests of justice to do so. When deciding whether to make such a direction a judge advocate may wish to consider (but is not limited to) such factors as: the defendant’s age; any compromise to his ability to participate effectively in the proceedings due to his level of intellectual ability, social functioning or any mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983; and whether use of a live link would enable him to participate more effectively in the proceedings as a witness. 34.

a. During permanent Service on call-out, whether by virtue of the statutory requirement under the Reserve Forces Act 1980 or the Reserve Forces Act 1996 or any other call-out obligation of an officer. (paragraph 11a)
b. During home defence Service on call-out. (paragraph 11b)
c. When engaged in a full-time Service commitment. (paragraph 11c)
e. When serving on the permanent staff of a reserve force. (paragraph 12e)

Additionally, reservists are subject to Service law during the period of recall under the Reserve Forces Act 1966. (paragraph 13)

In addition, members of the reserve forces may be tried for certain offences under Part X of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 even though not subject to Service law at the time. 12. A reservist undertaking service under any of paragraph 11a – c and e above will be subject to Service law during the whole period of that service whether they is travelling, physically working, resting or off duty. This is different in respect of duties undertaken under paragraph 11d above (this is likely to be most relevant to members of volunteer reserve forces attending short periods of training or duty). Broadly speaking, such a person will be subject to Service law while they are with their reserve force. So, for example, where they attends an 8 hour training period on a Saturday they will be subject to Service law during the time of the training period only and not when they is driving to the period or returning home from it. Staff legal advice should be obtained if there is any doubt as to whether a reservist was subject to Service law at the time they committed the alleged offence. 13. Recall. Any person who is recalled for service under the authority of a recall order made under the Reserve Forces Act 1996, or under an officer recall obligation, is for the purposes of the Act, regarded as being a member of the regular forces from the time that they is accepted into permanent service following their recall until they is discharged or released from that service.13 Accordingly, such persons will be subject to Service law at all times during this period of recall in the same way that Service law applies to the regular forces as described above.

This chapter sets out who may be subject to Service jurisdiction and who may exercise it. Although the avoidance of unnecessary delay is a key driver for all involved in the administration of discipline in the Services, the Armed Forces Act 2006 (the Act) does not generally contain formal time limits on the charging of persons as long as they remain subject to Service law or subject to Service discipline. Time limits are a concern, however, in relation to reservists, those who have left the regular or reserve forces and civilians who have ceased to be subject to Service discipline. Persons subject to Service law or Service discipline 2. The Act applies to two categories of persons; persons subject to Service law (both Service personnel1 and ex-Service personnel) and civilians subject to Service discipline (relevant civilians). Members of the regular forces2 are persons subject to Service law at all times and anywhere in the world. Reservists are subject to Service law only in the circumstances set out and explained in paragraphs 10 to 13 below. Forces of the British overseas territories are only subject to Service law when they are serving with Her Majesty’s forces. Persons will become civilians subject to Service discipline only in certain limited circumstances; see paragraphs 17 to 27 below. 3. Persons who fall into either of the two categories above who are alleged to have committed a Service offence3 may be investigated. If charged, a person subject to Service law may be brought before their commanding officer (CO) at summary hearing (for certain offences) or before the Court Martial (CM). A CO cannot hear a charge against a civilian subject to Service discipline; relevant civilians may only be brought before the Service Civilian Court (SCC) or be tried before the CM. 4. Any person subject to Service law or Service discipline may be tried before the CM.

This is a complex area of the law and in such cases staff legal advice should be sought. A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures86 the commission by another of any Service offence may be convicted of that offence. For example, A searches and removes a watch from a soldier detained in the course of an operation. If A does not have a reasonable excuse for his actions, he may have committed an offence of looting contrary to section 4 of the Act. If B agrees to keep a look out for A whilst they are committing the act, B may be charged under section 4 of the Act. 104. The same applies when a Service person or relevant civilian aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of a criminal offence by another person; Section 4287 applies to those who aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a criminal offence in the same way as to the principal offender. Whilst it is proper to charge an accessory as if he were a principal offender, it may sometimes be more appropriate to charge them as an accessory (e.g. when it is clear at the outset that he did not actually commit the offence themselves). The words aid, abet counsel and procure may all be used together to charge a person who is alleged to have participated in the offence in some way, but not as the principal offender. 105. By contrast, if a Service person encourages or assists another person to commit any offence, they are guilty not of the main offence, but of the separate offence of encouraging or assisting. If the encouraging or assisting is to commit criminal conduct which would be an offence under the law of England and Wales, the encouraging or assisting will be an offence under section 42 of the Act. If the encouraging or assisting is to commit an offence under the Act (other than a criminal conduct offence)88, the relevant offence will be under section 40 of the Act. For example, if A encourages or assists B to make a false record (contrary to section 18 of the Act), B should be charged with an offence under section 40, as A did not themselves make the false record. 106""  '

Your wellbeing at all stages of the Service Complaints system is important. In addition to support and advice provided by your Chain of Command (CoC), a range of independent support is available (see Annex Q) for further information. An Easy Read Guide providing a short summary of the Service Complaints process and what you can expect from it is also available. 3. It is the responsibility of all involved in the process to ensure complaints are handled confidentially, fairly, promptly and correctly. But it is important to note that if you do not engage in the investigation in a timely manner, the decision on a Service Complaint can be made on the basis of the evidence available. 4, This responsibility extends to Complainants, Respondents and all other persons involved in handling a Service Complaint, ensuring that they cooperate fully within the prescribed time limits, and in good faith, at all times. 5. The intent is that Service Complaints are dealt with at the lowest appropriate level possible and resolution achieved quickly. Where appropriate, with every effort being made to resolve a complaint informally at any stage. Full information on the informal complaints process can be found in JSP 763 - The MOD Behaviours and Informal Complaint Resolution Policy. 6.

Lay Solid Foundations. a. follow the Service Complaints policy and any single Service guidance. b. seek advice early. c. attempt to seek resolution of a Service Complaint at the lowest appropriate level; can the complaint be resolved informally? d. ensure early contact is established with the Complainant. e. make an early assessment; is it a Service Complaint and in time? Are you able/the right person to deal with the complaint? Can you resolve the complaint alone or do you require specialist advice? How should you investigate it? f. remember: a complaint on your watch is not a failure; not dealing with it is. Prompt, sound handling will reap benefits downstream for all involved. 2. Act Fairly and Promptly. a. treat the Complainant, Respondent and all others who are involved, impartially and consistently. b. ensure that all parties to a Service Complaint are appropriately assisted and supported throughout. c. make no assumptions until the facts are established. d. ensure that investigations are prompt, thorough and establish the facts. e. make prompt, fair and informed decisions within the published timescales. 3. Be Open and Transparent. a. keep all appropriate parties updated regularly on progress. Disclose all relevant information to the appropriate parties in accordance with existing policy and guidance. b. allow the Complainant, Respondent and any other party involved the opportunity to explain their position through appropriate means before a decision is made. c. communicate your decision promptly, in writing, and give reasons.""

Such products include fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks, and protein shakes (JSP 835.pdf, page 40). However, it is important to note that these supplements should not be used to compensate for poor food choices and an inadequate diet, but rather as a supplement when food intake or food choices are restricted due to operational constraints or other reasons (JSP 835.pdf, page 41). It is also recommended that Service personnel consult with registered nutritionists, registered dieticians, or other professionals with recognized expertise in performance-related nutrition before using dietary supplements (JSP 835.pdf, page 42).

Therefore, the answer to this question is: Dietary supplements such as fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks, and protein shakes can be used.

Recent studies1 suggest the use of supplements by members of the UK Armed Forces is widespread, and includes trainees, UK-based troops and those preparing to deploy, as well as personnel in operational theatres. Whilst the use of some supplements in certain circumstances can have positive effects, their misuse can have detrimental effects on the health of individuals and could lead to a positive Compulsory Drug Test (CDT) outcome. What are supplements? 2. The term supplement is used to describe a wide range of products ingested by individuals who desire a range of physiological and/or psychological effects from the provision of additional nutrients from the supplement. These nutrients may be absent from the normal daily diet, or may not be consumed in sufficient amounts to achieve ergogenic (performance enhancing) effects. Supplement products often claim to improve health and wellbeing and / or to sustain or improve some aspect of physical or mental performance. A number of products that are marketed as exercise or training supplements, actually contain drugs as part of their composition to increase their efficacy. These drugs include anabolic agents such as anabolic steroids, pro-hormones, peptide hormones and growth factors such as Erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, corticotrophins, and growth hormone. It is therefore important to distinguish between dietary supplements and drugs. 3. Dietary Supplements. Dietary supplements contribute to the nutritional needs of the body by providing significant amounts of carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, or trace elements, in a form that is readily used by the body. Fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks and protein shakes all fall into this category. Such products may not be generally needed in a normal military life style, but the taking of such dietary supplements is highly unlikely to lead to a positive CDT if they are responsibly sourced and used as directed. 4. Drugs. Drugs do not contribute significantly to the nutritional needs of the body and are consumed in microgram (μg) doses""  '

Suitable professionals include registered nutritionists, registered dieticians, and other professionals with recognised expertise in performance-related nutrition. Service personnel contemplating the use of dietary supplements should consider their efficacy, their cost, the risk to health and performance, and the potential for a positive CDT. The use of multiple dietary supplements at one time (stacking) should be discouraged. Dietary supplement use by children (i.e. individuals under 18 years of age) should also be discouraged. Information 11. The Defence Nutrition Working Group is examining issues regarding supplement use and misuse by UK military personnel. While current advice from the Defence Nutrition Advisory Service (DNAS) is that it is not necessary for any members of the UK military to take dietary supplements as the necessary energy and nutrient intake can be obtained from eating a regular and balanced diet, supporting guidance on the use of dietary supplements is being prepared for Service personnel who wish to consume them. 3 IOC Consensus Statement on Sports Nutrition, Lausanne Oct 2010.

A diet that provides adequate energy from a wide range of foods can meet the carbohydrate, protein, fat and micronutrient requirements of physical training and operations. Food provided by the MOD is scientifically researched and designed to provide the daily dietary intake required to sustain service personnel in all military environments. There is evidence that soldiers predominantly dependant on Operational Ration Packs (ORP) supplemented by limited quantities of frozen meat and fresh vegetables, in the harsh operational environment of Sangin, suffered no degradation in physical performance over the 6 month period of the deployment. In general, short-term energy restriction involving minimal loss of body mass has little effect on performance or health in otherwise healthy individuals. Losses of body mass in the region of 6 – 10% or higher have been shown to impair performance in a military setting, although this is not a consistent observation. 9. Dietary supplements should not be used to compensate for poor food choices and an inadequate diet where a choice exists, but dietary supplements that provide additional energy and / or essential nutrients may be useful when food intake or food choices are restricted for reasons including operational constraints, travel, and periods when preparation and / or consumption of adequate meals is not possible or desirable. The use of dietary supplements in such instances would reduce the risk of developing nutrient deficiencies that could impair both health and performance. 2 HFL Sport Science is an independent drug surveillance laboratory owned by LGC.""

The importance of access to justice for all and the right to legal representation has long been recognised in the UK. To support these principles, a formal legal aid scheme was established to provide publicly funded legal representation e.g. to defend against criminal charges in the magistrates’ and Crown Courts, for those who would otherwise be denied access to justice because they could not afford to pay for it. 2. The underpinning principles. The legal aid scheme is underpinned by the basic principle that those who can afford to pay some or all of their defence costs should do so, whereas those who cannot afford to contribute should receive legal aid support free of charge. Applying this basic principle enables public funds to be used to assist as many people as possible whilst also providing value for money for the taxpayer. As part of this tenet, it follows that, ultimately, the contribution paid by any convicted offender is limited to either their maximum contribution (based upon their personal and financial circumstances at the time of application1) or their actually legally aided costs, whichever is the lower; the maximum contribution includes the full pre-trial income contribution plus any post-trial capital/equity contribution.

Appeal against findings and/or the award of a punishment following summary hearings at unit level, including applications for extensions of the appeal period by the Summary Appeal Court, for leave to appeal out of time (Service and ex-Service personnel only); or b. Have a case referred to the Director Service Prosecutions (DSP), for a decision on whether the charges will result in a prosecution; this includes offences under Schedule 2 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 which are referred directly to the DSP by the Service police as well as matters referred to the DSP by the Commanding Officer; or c. Are to be tried in the Court Martial (CM) or the Service Civilian Court (SCC); or d. Wish to appeal in the CM, against the finding and/or sentence after trial in the SCC (relevant civilians only); or e. Are to be tried in a criminal court outside the UK (see Part 1, Section 5, and Part 2 Chapter 4). 6. The legal aid scheme applies equally to all members of the Armed Forces, including the Reserve Forces (when subject to Service law) and to civilians who are subject to Service discipline (relevant civilians). See JSP 830, Vol 1 Ch 3 – Jurisdiction and Time Limits4. 7. Non-criminal public funding. In certain circumstances, there may be a requirement for legal proceedings involving Service or relevant civilian personnel which fall outside the sphere of criminal proceedings and therefore the general scope of the Armed Forces Legal Aid Scheme. Part 1 Chapter 2 and Part 2 Chapter 6 provides full details on the eligibility criteria for those who may require publicly funded legal representation and the legal aid processes therein. 8.

If the applicant is on detached duty and unable to provide the documents immediately, they should annotate the application accordingly and make every attempt to obtain and forward them at the earliest opportunity (JSP 838 Part 2, page 111). Every defendant, regardless of their views on plea and representation, should submit a completed MOD F2263 application for administrative reasons (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 29, page 59). Upon receipt of a completed application and any Hardship Review, AFCLAA will make a formal offer of legal aid using a MOD F2263A – Contribution Order (JSP 838 Part 2, page 65).

Warn the defendant against approaching prosecution witnesses, discussing the case with them or asking them to ‘drop the charges’. Once the matter is reported the case is out of their hands and any such approach could be deemed a criminal offence (e.g. attempting to pervert the course of justice or witness interference/intimidation).

This guidance is written specifically for you, in your role as a Commanding Officer, to assist you in the care and management of personnel who have been the victim of the most serious crime, or who are considered to be persistently targeted, vulnerable or intimidated victims. This guidance aims to set out for you, step-by-step, the actions you must take, and the issues you must consider, where such allegations have been made. It also contains specific guidance for cases where a victim and alleged offender are in the same unit. 2. Managing incidents involving violence and/or a sexual element can be difficult, even for those who are trained to do so. There are two primary objectives, for the Commanding Officer, in such cases. First, you must ensure that the victim is provided with appropriate support. The incident may have happened very recently or perhaps some time ago but all victims are to be managed professionally, respectfully and sensitively regardless of any time lapse between the incident and the reporting of it. Secondly, all cases are to be handled in accordance with procedures laid down in the Manual of Service Law (volume 1, chapter 6). If you are in any doubt as to the procedures to be followed, you should contact the relevant Service discipline/legal branch for advice. 3. When an incident is reported to you, there are a number of issues you will need to consider. The steps below should be followed: a. Step 1. Offer immediate reassurance. When you see the victim it is important to remain calm, impartial and reassuring, and make clear to them that your immediate focus is on their safety and well-being. Where the complaint concerns a sexual offence, it may be appropriate to acknowledge their courage in reporting the offence to you b. Step 2. Determine the category of the victim. Consider whether the person falls into any of the categories defined at Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Annex. If not, the procedures at Reference B should be followed. c. Step 3.

The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (AFPS 15) arose from this and was introduced on 1 April 2015. 1.2 Those serving personnel who were within ten years of their previous scheme’s Normal Pension Age on 1 April 2012 were granted Transitional Protection and were not eligible to transfer to AFPS 15, instead remaining in their existing pension scheme. 1.3 Those serving personnel who were not eligible for Transitional Protection and who transitioned direct from their legacy pension scheme into AFPS 15, or who re-joined on or after 1 April 2015 were granted protection of all pension benefits that had been earned under their legacy scheme. 1.4 Personnel who had left the Armed Forces prior to 1 April 2015, with either a pension in payment or a pension in deferment, retain their full pension rights from their legacy scheme.

For those described in paras 1125 (a) and 1126, any subsequent dependants’ benefits will be paid in accordance with normal AFPS 05 rules. So, for example, the spouse’s pension would be calculated by multiplying the member’s final pensionable earnings by the amount of reckonable service he was allowed to count, and the result multiplied by 1/112. However, it is understood that there is nobody within the scope of the AFPS 05 GOTT who falls into this category. 1128. For those described at para 1125 (b), their GPS pension will be replaced by EDP benefits. The amount of the pension which will come into payment when they reach age 65 will be calculated by the Scheme Actuary, taking into account the HMRC rule which does not allow the payment of a second pension commencement lump sum. The EDP will be calculated in the usual way (see Part 2 of this JSP). EDP payments will be backdated to the last day of service and arrears will be adjusted to take account of the amount of GPS pension already paid. 1129.

0,,,,,,,How do I integrate human factors into the design of a new piece of equipment?,"According to JSP 912 Part 1.pdf (page 6), Human Factors Integration (HFI) is more than just Human Factors Engineering (HFE). HFI includes five domains: personnel, training, human factors engineering, system safety & health hazards, and social & organizational. To integrate human factors into the design of a new piece of equipment, one should consider each of these domains.

1. Personnel: Identify the roles and responsibilities of the people who will operate and maintain the equipment. Consider their physical and cognitive abilities, as well as their training requirements.
2. Training: Design training programs that effectively prepare personnel to use the equipment safely and efficiently. This may include developing instructional materials, conducting training sessions, and evaluating training effectiveness.
3. Human Factors Engineering: Apply principles of human factors engineering to the design of the equipment. This may involve designing controls and displays that are intuitive and easy to use, ensuring adequate space for personnel to work safely, and minimizing physical demands on operators.
4. System Safety & Health Hazards: Identify potential safety hazards and health risks associated with the equipment and design mitigation strategies to minimize these risks. This may involve conducting risk assessments, designing protective systems, and implementing safe work procedures.
5. Social & Organizational: Consider the social and organizational factors that will impact the use of the equipment. This may include identifying cultural differences that could affect acceptance of the equipment, designing interfaces that are compatible with existing organizational structures, and developing strategies to promote adoption and effective use of the equipment.

JSP 912 Part 2.pdf (page 48) also emphasizes the importance of considering human factors during the design and development of new equipment. It suggests identifying risks and concerns associated with the design, necessary risk mitigation activities, required modifications to ensure the equipment is fit for purpose in its military context, and any Human Factors analyses that have been applied during the design process.

Therefore, to integrate human factors into the design of a new piece of equipment, one should apply a multi-disciplinary approach that considers the needs and limitations of personnel, training requirements, human factors engineering principles, system safety and health hazards, and social and organizational factors. (Citations: JSP 912 Part 1.pdf pages 6-7 and JSP 912 Part 2.pdf page 48","['This passage is from JSP 912 Part 1.pdf, page 6: ""1 Introduction Policy 1. The terms ‘Human Factors (HF)’, ‘Human Factors Engineering (HFE)’ and ‘Human Factors Integration’ are often confused. ‘Human Factors’ refers to a range of disciplines (principally scientific), which relate to the study of human capabilities, limitations, characteristics and behaviour in the broadest possible sense. It includes the study of human interactions with technologies and social interactions and draws on many scientific disciplines, including ergonomics, psychology (and neuropsychology), physiology, biology, anthropometry and biomechanics. It provides the knowledge base from which Human Factors Engineering draws. HFE is concerned with the application of this knowledge in the design, development, assessment, fielding, in-service support and disposal of products – equipment, sub-systems, systems and platforms. In contrast, HFI is a management activity, which includes a systematic process for identifying, tracking and resolving people-related considerations (especially risks and issues), to ensure a balanced development of both technological and human aspects of capability. 2. It is imperative to understand that HFI is more than HFE. It comprises the following five domains: a. Personnel. b. Training. c. Human Factors Engineering. d. System Safety & Health Hazards. e. Social & Organisational. 3. Details of these domains are included in Part 2 (Guidance) of this JSP. The HFI Domains span a number of different technical disciplines and are not entirely the owned by the Human Factors Specialist. For effective Human Factors Integration, a number of different, but related disciplines need to interact in order to ‘deliver’ HFI.

Why Consider the Human Component of Capability? 6. Although many Defence Acquisition projects are concerned with the acquisition of technology (i.e. infrastructure, platforms, equipment, hardware, software), even in so-called uninhabited systems, such tangible items must be operated, maintained and supported by people. Thus, whatever their nature, degree of complexity or technological sophistication, systems that provide Defence Capability comprise: a. Infrastructure, equipment, hardware, software, information and material necessary to deliver the required capability (referred to collectively in this document as the ‘Equipment Component’) and; b. MOD Service personnel and Civilian support staff, together with the organisations and structures in which people work, (referred to in this document as the ‘Human Component’). 7. Failure to consider the Human Component of Capability can have many adverse consequences: increased risk of accidents and incidents; higher training costs; reduced performance and mission effectiveness; breaches in duty of care; scarcity of appropriately skilled personnel; delays to the project schedule and substantial increases in design / redesign costs. 8. To achieve the required capability, both of these components must work in close combination and harmony. The effectiveness and efficiency of the resulting system, or a constituent part, may depend critically on the Human Component and the adequacy of this combination. Of critical importance is that the People and Equipment Components must be effectively integrated together. 9. These components are typically linked by operational, organisational and management processes, as illustrated in Figure 1. Human-Centred Design is the approach that seeks to accommodate human needs within the design of technological products/systems [4]. HFI Domains 10.

It also provides environmental benefits over traditional options. Better coordination of activity, guidance and acquisition are needed to enable Defence to exploit the maximum benefit from investment in M&S. This JSP sets out appropriate direction, clear governance structures and suitable mechanisms to resolve issues and reduce risk, enabling the Front Line Commands (FLCs) to develop and deliver M&S based solutions in a technically coherent manner. Under the direction and guidance of the Defence Modelling and Simulation Coherence (DMaSC) Technical Authority (TA), the aim is to provide a coherent framework of M&S enablers and resources, accessed through the Defence Simulation Centre (DSC), that are reusable, interoperable, reconfigurable and cost effective, not just across the Defence Enterprise but also with our Allies.

The role of the Defence Modelling and Simulation Coherence (DMaSC) Technical Authority (TA) is to promote Value for Money (VfM) at the Defence Enterprise level and build corporate knowledge supported by the Defence Simulation Centre (DSC)2. 2. This JSP applies to all uses of M&S. However, due to resource constraints, the initial focus of the DMaSC TA and the DSC will be primarily on training capabilities unless directed otherwise by the TA. 3. NATO defines M&S as the discipline that ‘develops and/or uses models, simulations and simulation systems’3. It is important to note that M&S is a term in itself and not the sum of the two words ‘modelling’ and ‘simulation’. 4. The NATO definitions of ‘model’ and ‘simulation’ are3: a. Model - a physical, mathematical or otherwise logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process; and b. Simulation - the execution of a system model over time. 5. M&S is a key enabler for Defence that is increasingly supporting a wide range of activity that includes: decision making, training and education, mission rehearsal, acquisition, operational analysis, test and evaluation, and experimentation.

DTC – 3.1. 109 The DTC will deliver Defence Trainers that are fit for purpose. Trainers110 are not only the focus for teaching knowledge and skills but also for inspiring, encouraging, supporting and challenging teams, through strong leadership, role modelling and coaching. Well-motivated teams become independent learners, who continue to regulate their learning wherever they are. Whatever their ability levels, teams require regular feedback and support to help them assess their knowledge and skills so that they can learn to identify and set their own goals for further professional development. 2. Defence Trainer attributes. Defence Trainers need to be able to inspire, motivate and challenge teams, understand their learning needs and expectations, and be able to draw on the right tools and techniques to get the very best from them. To be fully effective, trainers should therefore understand and fulfil both the Roles of the specialist trainer and that of leader, which include: a. Role modelling. Through the adoption and promotion of the Service core values, trainers lay the foundations for the behaviours that build team cohesion and underpin operational effectiveness. Role modelling is therefore a core responsibility. b. Facilitating inclusive learning. Trainers should create an inclusive learning environment where all teams have the opportunity to learn and reach their full potential. Good trainers are able to facilitate learning in the most appropriate way to suit the needs of the teams. Trainers will need a sound understanding of learning theory and a broad range of skills including the use of modern teaching techniques, learning technologies and coaching. c. Assessment of learning. Assessment is an essential part of training delivery and trainers are often asked to make critical decisions regarding teams’ progress through training and subsequent achievement of the required standards""  '

The MOD aims to achieve this by ensuring the correct standards are maintained through Governance, Assurance, and Improvement of acquisition, engineering, and logistics support activities (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 5, section 1.2). All top management within MOD Organisations shall implement these requirements for Governance, Assurance, and Improvement by ensuring organisation requirements are reflected in operational frameworks, policies, processes, and plans, and that they are effectively implemented (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 5, section 1.2b). The MOD also maintains its risk and process-based approach for managing Quality and applies NATO standards appropriately as part of risk mitigation in delivering assurance to defence capability in the UK and across the NATO alliance (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 2, Foreword).

To ensure effective delivery of Quality Management, all top management within MOD Organisations shall take responsibility for the quality of the products, services, capabilities, or information they are managing, and develop and implement a Quality Management System using the principles defined in the ISO 9000 standard (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 6, section 1.3). They shall also ensure that suitably qualified and experienced personnel are developed across the department to enable the effective delivery of Quality Management and Government Quality Assurance (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 6, section 1.3c).

The Defence Authority for Technical and Quality Assurance is responsible for championing the Quality profession across all civilian and military staff in the defence workforce, sponsoring MOD civilian functional competences for Quality, and maintaining a strategic overview of Quality specific competences and training available across all MOD Top Level Budget areas (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 3).

When using the lowest price strategy, the contract will be awarded to the tender with the lowest cost that is technically and commercially compliant. MEAT evaluation strategy provides the opportunity to take criteria other than price into account when awarding a contract. Appropriate, specific, and relevant award criteria are scored and weighted to establish which tender is most economically advantageous (JSP 507 Part 1.pdf, pages 43-44). Pre-Contract Award Evaluation (PCAE) may also be used to mitigate or identify risks associated with a specific Tenderer or the associated bid by evaluating their ability to meet draft contract requirements (JSP 940 Part 2.pdf, page 50)","['This passage is from JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 150: ""terms will be judged as the Most Economically Advantageous Tender. Where two or more tenders have the same cost, the tender with the highest technical score should be judged as the Most Economically Advantageous Tender. 36. Any tender on the line from the origin 0 to Tender C will be assessed as better value for money (more economically advantageous) than tenders on the line 0A, which in turn will be better value for money than tenders on the line from 0 to Tender B. 37. Adding risk and uncertainty to the bids and estimated whole life costs, and subjecting this to Monte Carlo analysis allows the outputs to be expressed as 10%, 50%, and 90% confidence figures. The 10/50/90 percentiles of two bids may overlap, so it is then necessary to have a decision rule, particularly when a ‘lowest price’ strategy is to be used, to establish if the bids are sufficiently different from each other such that one could be selected as having the lowest cost. Defence Economics and D Scrutiny must always be consulted in such cases. Sensitivity Analysis 38. It is good practice to test any proposed criterion, weighting, and calculations in a variety of scenarios prior to issue of the Tender Documentation to ensure that various permutations of tenders (e.g. close tenders, abnormally low tenders, low technical scores etc.) do not distort the result or produce unexpected outcomes. Disclosure 39. Proposals to disclose financial information such as affordability envelopes or budget profiles to industry must be compliant with legal obligations including those of transparency and equal treatment, and. Assessing Value for Money Through-Life 40. When the Department is considering entering into partnering arrangement at the investment level, or an LTPA, or any form of non-competitive contract, the business case must establish how the continuing value for money will be assessed through the life of the agreement or contract. Clear performance targets must be established, against which industry’s performance will be assessed. 41. Details should be provided in the business case of the regular reviews, targets, and quality standards that will be used to assess and manage industry’s performance""  '

Tender Evaluation and Value for Money 64. Public contracts must be competed in accordance with Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (PCR) or Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR) (the Regulations). 65. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) enshrines principles of proportionality, equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency which the MOD must apply in relation to its contract award criteria. Application of these principles also needs to be consistent with the policy requirement to demonstrate value for money. 66. This guidance is complementary and supplementary to that contained within the Tendering Suite of Commercial Policy Statements (see www.aof.dii.r.mil.uk) addressing the key issues to ensure that commercial, legal and economic requirements are coherently addressed when establishing the criteria for tender evaluation. Evaluation Strategy 67. The first decision to make is the appropriate evaluation strategy for the proposal, and this is then published in the Contract Notice. In accordance with Regulation 31 of DSPCR and Regulation 30 of PCR, the evaluation strategy can be based on either: a. Lowest price (lowest cost). The contract will be awarded to the ‘lowest price’ tender that is technically and commercially compliant. This cannot be used if the Competitive Dialogue procedure is being followed. or b. Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT). Using an evaluation based on MEAT provides the opportunity to take criteria other than price into account when awarding a contract. There are several MEAT evaluation strategies that can be adopted. These are set out in the Commercial Policy Statement on Tender Management. Award Criteria 68. Award criteria are the criteria the tenders must meet and those that the tenders will be measured against. Where a MEAT evaluation strategy is used, appropriate, specific and relevant award criteria are scored and weighted to establish which tender is most economically advantageous""  '

It is a systematic evaluation of a Tenderer’s ability to meet draft contract requirements and is undertaken by the MOD Acquisition Organisation, at the Tenderer’s premises, in support of project TA activities. 4.4.4.2 When to use PCAE Where concerns exist regarding the Tenderer’s past performance or the proposed controls detailed in the Tenderer’s bid, PCAE may be used to explore the validity of these concerns and establish the level of risk associated with the Tenderer’s bid and enable the development of effective risk mitigation activities. The requirement to undertake PCAE is a decision taken by the MOD Acquisition Organisation and should be included in any Special Notices and Instructions47 raised in support of the draft contract. PCAE may be applied to a number of functional areas within the Tenderer’s organisation. This guidance considers the implementation of PCAE within the Tenderer’s Quality Management (QM) function only. 4.4.4.3 The Process The evaluation process seeks to establish evidence that supports the effective application of QM controls by the Tenderer throughout the Tenderer’s organisation and throughout the supply chain that the Tenderer proposes to use. Where evidence cannot be presented by the Tenderer, the MOD Acquisition Organisation need to establish the potential impact on the contract deliverables and ensure the impact is captured and assessed in the tender assessment documentation. Evaluation of individual Tenderer’s QM controls cannot be performed using a ‘one-size fits all’ process. Evaluation activities need to be tailored to suit concerns or perceived risks with the respective Tenderer’s bid. When planning an evaluation of the Tenderer’s QM controls, the MOD Acquisition Organisation should, as a minimum, address the following generic areas: a. the Tenderer’s ability to plan for the delivery of a product that conforms to specified requirements, including identification and understanding of contract requirements. b""  '

It includes documentation changes for both software and hardware, and can be driven by various reasons such as risk mitigation, legal or regulatory change, improvement of quality, safety, interoperability, performance, or reduction of operating/support costs (JSP 945 Part 2, page 6). CM is the through-life management of changes to a product or service and enables changes and different build standards to be traced back to the system requirements (JSP 945 Part 1, page 7).

CM and Planning. CM describes the activities and processes required to ensure that changes to the Configuration Items (CIs) happen in a controlled and traceable environment. The Project Configuration Management Plan (PCMP) details how and when these activities and processes will be carried out. The PCMP itself will be subject to CM (version control) and will be reviewed at a periodicity set by the document owner. b. Configuration Identification. An activity that identifies a component, document or assembly, referred to as a CI by its physical, functional, or performance characteristics. This can be by means of drawings, specifications (both hardware and software), or datasheets. Not all items are classified as CIs. The classification of an item as a CI can be decided by the Design Organisation or by mutual agreement between the Project Team and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The item must conform to strict criteria detailed in the Configuration Management documentation. c. Configuration Change Management (Control).

0,,,,,,,How are configuration change requests managed?,"According to JSP 945 Part 2.pdf, configuration change requests are managed through Configuration Change Management (CCM). CCM ensures various aspects of managing changes to configuration baselines, including control, coherence between product and documentation, dissemination of change, stakeholder communication, and recording and management of concessions, repairs, deviations, or any other non-conformance. The process involves impact assessment, determination of applicability, cost estimation, disposition (approval/rejection) by a Configuration Change Control Board or Configuration Change Committee, implementation and verification, and categorization of changes (JSP 945 Part 2.pdf, pages 6, 18).

The change request process includes carrying out an impact assessment detailing risks, timescales for implementation, and providing a fielding plan. The Design Organisation and Dispositioning Authority determine the applicability of the Change Request and identify the configuration items requiring change. Considerations include interchangeability, interfaces between configuration items, test and inspection methods, inventory, delivery activities, support requirements, and prioritization based on safety (JSP 945 Part 2.pdf, page 18).

If the change is authorized, the meeting will consider the proposed start date, initiation of changes, further activities, responsible parties for carrying out or fitting the change, and any necessary training, location adjustments, down time, and shipping equipment (JSP 945 Part 2.pdf, page 18).

DCS is a range of surgical interventions aimed at halting deterioration of the patient's physiological condition, while In-Theatre Surgery consists of several surgical procedures spread over a period of time and may require the movement of patients between Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs). The main difference lies in their objectives and timing. DCS is designed to stabilize the patient pending further medical evacuation, whereas In-Theatre Surgery occurs within a DHC unit and includes a combination of general, orthopaedic, and burns & plastic surgery to restore physiological parameters as close to normal as possible before safe evacuation to a definitive care facility.

In particular, DCS will require critical care support either at that Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) or at an alternative MTF accessible by Critical Care Air Support Team level TACEVAC within an appropriate timeline. DCS should be followed later on by In-Theatre Surgery, which is delayed until the various physiological and other relevant parameters have been restored to as close to normal as possible. It can only occur within a DHC unit. This usually requires a combination of general and orthopaedic surgery and should include burns & plastic surgery wherever possible. (3) In-Theatre Surgery. In-Theatre Surgery may consist of several surgical procedures spread over a period of time and may require the movement of patients between MTFs within a theatre of operations. The requirement for In-Theatre Surgery is dictated by both the patient’s condition and operational circumstances. The factors to be considered when considering a patient’s condition include the requirement to halt physiological deterioration and adequate debridement, anatomical repair and therapeutic intervention to allow safe evacuation to a definitive care facility; operational factors may include extended evacuation timelines that demand further definitive surgical interventions for patient safety; appropriate definitive surgery to permit deliberate retention in-theatre and appropriate definitive surgery for patients ineligible for evacuation out of theatre. (4) Enhanced Diagnostics. Enhanced diagnostics are those clinical support activities (e.g. CT scan if not available as part of DCS, interventional radiology, and specialist laboratory support including biochemistry, haematology and microbiology testing) that enable clinical therapies to address the specific cause of injury or illness that are additional to generic stabilising therapies.

d) Commanders or Duty Holders ensure a suitable FHP risk assessment for the deployment/exercise has been undertaken by their medical staff, all personnel receive a pre-deployment health brief, and all personnel deploying to a malaria risk area have undergone a malaria health risk assessment before they deploy (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 2).
e) All vector control and bite avoidance control measures are enforced (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 2).
f) Personnel understand the risk posed to themselves and the operation by malaria and are encouraged to comply with malaria preventive measures, including chemoprophylaxis regimes (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 2).

 'This passage is from JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 2: ""General 9. Malaria remains a disease of global and historical importance. It is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. In 2015/16, there was an estimated 212 million cases of malaria with 429,000 deaths worldwide. 90% of cases and 92% of deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.6 Malaria is a disease of military significance, with the outbreak amongst UK troops in Sierra Leone in 2000 generating attack rates of 10% in certain groups.7 The British Armed Forces have been largely successful in mitigating the threat from malaria. Between October 2014 and November 2015, 1530 individuals were deployed on Operation GRITROCK during the British military response to the outbreak of Ebola viral haemorrhagic fever in West Africa.8 During this period there were only seven cases of malaria and UK Armed Forces have not experienced an operationally related death from malaria since 1992.9 10. The prevention of malaria is based upon four principles: a. Awareness of risk. b. Bite prevention. c. Chemoprophylaxis. d. Diagnose promptly and treat without delay. In addition, the military Chain of Command has a key role to play through the integration of malaria preventive measures into force health protection (FHP) risk assessments and plans. Responsibilities 11. Commanders or Duty Holders are to ensure that: a. A suitable FHP risk assessment10 for the deployment/exercise has been undertaken by their medical staff. b. Where compliance with malaria preventive measures cannot be fully achieved for operational reasons the residual risk is acknowledged and managed in accordance with JSP 892: Risk Management. c. All personnel receive a pre-deployment health brief. d. All personnel deploying to a malaria risk area have undergone a malaria health risk assessment before they deploy. e.

 'This passage is from JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 11: ""1 Context of Human Security in UK Defence 0101. International Framework of Human Security. The concept of HS integrates three freedoms: ‘Freedom from Fear’ (denoting violent threats to populations), ‘Freedom from Want’ (meaning poverty and absence of basic needs) and ‘Freedom from Indignity’ (which includes human rights abuses and limits on democratic participation). These have been developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to include all threats to the wellbeing of human beings and everything that affects the security of human beings.2 HS is an approach to national and international security which places emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state. Moving the security agenda beyond state security does not mean replacing it. Instead, it complements and builds on it. This concept has continued to evolve. Threats such as natural disasters, conflicts, chronic and persistent poverty, health pandemics and international terrorism continue to compromise the prospects of sustainable development, peace and stability. When these threats overlap, they become insecurity multipliers, exacerbating existing issues. The cumulative effect of this insecurity can be catastrophic, for individuals, but also for communities, nations and regions.3 This HS concept is now an international framework4 that considers pre, inter and post conflict phases, examines early warning mechanisms and responds to violent and destabilising situations. 0102. National Policy and Strategy. The UK’s HS approach is governed by domestic and international law and is complementary to the following UK Government strategies: a. Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict; b. UK National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security 2018-2022; c. Modern Slavery Strategy; d. UK Anti-Corruption Strategy 2017-2022; e. Building Stability Overseas and the CONTEST Strategy. 0103. UK Defence’s Human Security Approach. Individual and community security is the foundation for long term stability, economic and infrastructure development, political settlement, better societal relationships, good governance and the rule of law. In recognition of this, the UK MOD has embedded several security themes under the term HS""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 2: ""Foreword We live in a world of rapid change, with technological advances, cultural shifts and the degradation of our natural environment impacting the world around us at a speed we have never seen before. As the world has changed, so too has the character of conflict. Human Rights violations, the targeting of civilians and the destruction of cultural property are being increasingly weaponised in armed conflict and used to create instability. Universal threats to the population continue to compromise the prospects of sustainable development, peace and stability. As these threats overlap and multiply, the cumulative effect of insecurity can be catastrophic for individuals, communities, nations and regions. UK Defence must keep pace to address these changing threats and, to do this, we must adopt a Human Security approach. Human Security is an approach to national and international security which places the emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state. Moving the security agenda beyond state security does not mean replacing it; rather, it complements and builds on it. It is applicable to situations above and below the threshold of armed conflict, across all domains and surpasses geographical boundaries. This pervasiveness of Human Security means that it is vital that it is considered across the spectrum of UK Defence. UK Defence’s Human Security approach is governed by international and domestic law and is underpinned by United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), NATO policies and the National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security. This JSP directs the UK Armed Forces to implement those UNSCRs which relate to Human Security considerations. It explains why and how UK Defence must incorporate Human Security considerations in all that it does, from strategic planning through to the activity performed at the operational and tactical levels. In doing this, we will be able to better plan conflict sensitive outcomes by understanding the impacts on the human environment, minimising harm to civilians and reducing Human Rights’ violations, ultimately improving the conditions for stability""  '
