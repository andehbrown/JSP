0,What steps do I have to take to decommission a bulk fuel installation?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 63, when a bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset is no longer required on a permanent basis, it can be decommissioned. This is defined as subjecting the bulk fuel infrastructure asset to an engineering process that leaves it in a safe state without the need for further maintenance. The detailed planning for the decommissioning process, including stakeholder actions, costs, and work required to achieve the new state, should be planned, authorized, and carried out as part of the activity detailed in paragraph 19 (this is of paramount importance and must be adhered to). The exact steps for decommissioning are not specified in the text, but it is mentioned that it is an irreversible process. (Paragraph 17)

A permanent reduction in the operational requirement to store petroleum products has created a redundant bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset that will not be returned to service. c. A bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset that is beyond economical repair. 17. If a situation relating to the information provided in paragraph 17 materialises, the bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset is not to be abandoned; instead the asset is to transition from an operational state to one of three other recognised states, detailed below in this paragraph. In such instances, stakeholder actions for the entirety of the project’s life, associated costs and the detailed work required to achieve the required new state is to be planned, authorised and carried out as part of the activity detailed in paragraph 19 (this is of paramount importance and must be adhered to). a. Mothballing. This defines a bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset that is not in use but is undergoing a maintenance programme that will enable it to be returned to an operational state in a pre-determined time-period. (1) Tanks. The time-period for a tank to remain in a mothballed state cannot exceed the next periodic inspection (clean, inspect, repair). As this is typically a periodicity of 5 to 8 years, that would be the maximum timescale a tank could remain in a mothballed state. The exact deadline for each specific project would need to be discussed and officially recorded as part of the specific asset project activity. (2) Pipelines. The time-period for a pipeline is harder to define, but it should be based on the known condition and on-going maintenance requirements. The exact deadline will depend on the specific asset project. It would need to be discussed and officially recorded as part of the specific asset project activity. b. Decommissioning. When a bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset is no longer required on a permanent basis, it can be decommissioned. This is defined as subjecting the bulk fuel infrastructure asset to an engineering process that leaves it in a safe state8 without the need for further maintenance9. It is an irreversible process. As part of the specific asset project activity in paragraph 19, it would need to be decided whether the asset was going to be either: (1) Demolished in a short timeframe; or, (2) Decommissioned for the long-term and demolished at a later date. c. Demolition. Once an asset is decommissioned it will ultimately require full demolition at some point i.e. it is completely removed10 and a land quality assessment is undertaken.

The disposal of waste F-37 is to be through the current fuel disposal contract. Until its collection, the bowser containing the waste F-37 is to be quarantined. Before the bowser can be used to carry fuel other than F-37, the tank is to be flushed and the coalescer replaced. The tank must then be partially filled with F-34 or F-35 and samples drawn off for analysis by the appropriate laboratory. If 2 consecutive batches of samples return results that determine that the fuel is outside its specification, the bowser is to be cleaned and the coalescers replaced as necessary.  Bibliography 1.

1. Suitable clothing preferably made from flame-retardant (FR) material (BS EN ISO 11611).
2. Flame-resistant outer clothing, manufactured from a material with close-formed fabric, such as Gortex™.
3. Water-resistant outer clothing.
4. PVC or leather gloves (BS EN 511) that are loose-fitting and have an elasticated knitted wrist.
5. Safety boots (BS EN ISO 20345) with internal impact resistant toecaps.
6. Helmet, ear defenders, visor mount assembly, and visor.
7. Face shield.
8. Cryogenic high leg safety boots.
9. Approved gloves for handling valves or metal parts through which a cryogenic liquid flows.
10. A face shield and safety glasses that specifically protect the eyes from liquid ingress.
11. No jewellery, especially on hands and wrists, is recommended when working with cryogenic liquids.

It is also important to note that you should not wear NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) equipment in a cryogenic liquid environment unless specifically addressed during the risk assessment. Additionally, items that have the potential to cause a spark, such as personal electronic devices and matches, are forbidden in close proximity to cryogenic liquids.

Recommendations on the correct shade of filter lens to use are found in BS EN 169.  A backing lens should be used if the filter lens is not robust in accordance with BS EN 169.  Suitable clothing preferably made from flame-retardant (FR) material should be worn (BS EN ISO 11611).  Suitable leather gloves or gauntlets (BS EN 12477) should be worn during operations or when handling metal.    PPE for use when handling Cryogenic Liquids.  Many so-called non-flammable textile materials will burn fiercely in air containing as little as 30% oxygen, and no material should be considered totally safe.  Fabrics such as nylon should not be worn as these can increase the severity of burns in a fire situation.    Clothes should be well fitting, yet easy to remove.

Gloves shall be regularly checked for contamination e.g. by oil and grease, and any contaminated gloves are to be replaced.  Hand gloves are to be the standard item used, however, where there is a specific requirement identified in the process risk assessment for the operator to have to work with hands at or above chest level gauntlet style gloves may be used.    A face shield prevents injury to exposed skin and particularly the eyes. In addition to the face shield, the use of safety glasses which specifically protect the eyes from liquid ingress should be considered as part of the PPE Assessment.    The wearing of jewellery specifically on the hands and wrists e.g., watches, rings, is not recommended when working with cryogenic liquids.    It is recommended that, wherever practicable, NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) equipment is NOT worn in a cryogenic liquid’s environment.  When there is a requirement to wear NBC equipment, oxygen bay protective clothing is to be worn over the top of the NBC equipment. Pure carbon (in the form of charcoal or activated carbon) is shock sensitive when contaminated with liquid or gaseous oxygen; and, if ignited, burns explosively.

In overseas locations without MOD schools (or without MOD schools catering for the required stage of education) local education provision may be accessed where it delivers efficient and suitable education. In English-speaking locations overseas4 personnel are to make use of state provision. In non-English-speaking locations (or English-speaking locations without suitable state provision) personnel may make use of private education provision. In some overseas locations there may be no efficient and suitable education provision, state or private. Limitations of Local Education Provision. It is unlikely that overseas schools will follow the English National Curriculum and some subjects, including those that are compulsory under the English National Curriculum, may not be available. The syllabus, teaching approach or coverage may also be very different. In addition, National Curriculum assessments and tests may not be offered. There may also be variation in the ages that children start formal education. In some locations, this may not be until aged 6 or 7.

Civilian users must comply with MOD’s insurance requirements as set out in Part 2.   3 Fees and Charges Introduction 1. The disparate geography, capability and MOD requirements of aerodromes do not lend themselves to centralised pricing. Additional seasonal and operational conditions may play a significant factor in defining rates. In any event it is important for units to not undercut local commercial airfields and as such unit Budget Managers assisted by DIO are encouraged to assess and set their own fees structure based on what the market will bear, with the approval of their TLBs. Ideally this should be done having regard to the full resource cost of providing the facilities and services increased to levels which equate to the prevailing market rate. This should be reviewed no less than annually. 2. Transparency in charging is essential to ensure the reputation of MOD is sustained. Additional charges should be articulated to applicants as far as possible in advance. Units should provide civil users with an estimate of total charges, including indemnity fees prior to accepting the civil aircraft. 3. Fees collected by units are held at TLB level. It is for the TLB holder to decide how income is dispersed3. TLBs are encouraged, as an incentive to units for providing services to civilian users, to allow a proportion of receipts to be retained at local level once Control Totals have been met. Reduced Charges 4. In certain circumstances MOD considers it appropriate to reduce some or all charges at MOD aerodromes. Further information on what charges may be abated or waived are in Part 2 Annex C. Value Added Tax 5.

The structure of the charges should be of a standard format and iaw ICAO 9082. Units should aim to provide applicants with the likely total costs for using their facility in advance. 15. Indicative charges for landing and navigation services at MOD aerodromes are detailed at Annex G and should be considered a benchmark rather than the minimum or maximum prices to be levied. It is for individual units to assess and frequently review their charges with the consent of their TLB2. No reduction in charges should be made because any aerodrome facilities are unavailable. Aerodromes may offer seasonal variations in price. When electing to do so this must be published in advance and take account of pricing at local civilian airfields offering similar services. 16. Services utilised by civil aircraft at MOD aerodromes must be provided without additional costs being incurred by MOD. Services are provided from irreducible spare capacity within the station or unit, which for wider strategic or other reasons must be retained. For example, Fire, Crash and Air Traffic Control services may have to be available 24 hours-a-day but are not fully utilised for defence tasks at all times and can therefore be used to handle civil aircraft within the spare capacity available. 17. Units may elect to approve civil aircraft out of normal watch hours. However, it is possible that the provision of these services could result in additional costs being incurred by MOD, e.g. civilian overtime or notional costs associated with calling out of Service personnel. To ensure that any such costs are recouped, civil aircraft movements outside normal watch hours should be subject to an additional surcharge. 18. Parking and Housing Fees are intended to cover short term use. The definition of short term is a matter for CO/HoE’s discretion, but it is recommended that it should not usually exceed 2 months. Should a civil user wish to park or house an aircraft on MOD property for longer than 2 months, they should enter into a lease or licence agreement (as appropriate) with DIO, who will advise on an appropriate monthly rent or fee. 19. When setting charges units must always bear in mind that the overarching principle is to recover costs while avoiding undercutting private sector airfields, as this could lead to public allegations of a breach of competition law through inappropriate use of a public subsidy.

This document supersedes that issued on 1 February 2019. Issue 1. To provide clarification that civilian aircraft operators conducting Display Flying activity at MOD aerodromes must comply with MOD’s minimum insurance requirements of £50 million aviation liability insurance cover. This requirement does not relate to ‘static display’ aircraft and the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes should be followed if no Display Flying activity is being undertaken. Timing 2. With immediate effect. This policy statement remains extant until withdrawn or superseded. Introduction 3. Civilian aircraft operators conducting Display Flying activity at MOD aerodromes expose MOD to additional risks of compensation claims for either injury to personnel or damage to property. MOD must ensure that it is adequately protected against the consequences of these risks by ensuring that appropriate aviation liability insurance is in place to respond to a Display Flying related incident. Background 4. The recent comprehensive review of JSP 360 – Use of Military Aerodromes by Civil Aircraft – provided the opportunity to review insurance-related content and make a clear distinction between the insurance requirements of aircraft taking off and landing at a MOD aerodrome and those aircraft conducting Display Flying activity. 5. The issue was subsequently tabled for discussion with the Department’s professional insurance brokers, Willis Towers Watson, in the autumn of 2018. It was recognised that there is a clear distinction between routine operations and training and aircraft conducting Display Flying activity. Consideration was given to an appropriate insurance limit of liability relevant to the risk exposure at MOD aerodromes. Consensus from experts at the Willis aerospace team and MOD’s claims officials was that a limit of indemnity insurance commensurate with the risks associated with Display Flying activities should be adopted which is available in the prevailing aviation market.""

APPENDIX 2 TO ANNEX C TO JSP 360 PART 2 DATED DEC 20 MOD AVIATION DISPLAY INSURANCE POLICY STATEMENT SUPPORTING Q&A The definitions within the military regulations for the conduct of Display Flying activity at Flying Displays conducted over MOD occupied property are detailed in Regulatory Article (RA) 2335 – Flying Displays and Flypasts within the 2000 Series of the Military Aviation Authority Regulatory Publications (MRP). Q1. What is the definition of a Flying Display? A1. Any event at which Display Flying is deliberately performed for the purpose of providing an exhibition or entertainment. (A Flying Display is an event.) Q2. What is the definition of Display Flying? A2. Display Flying is any flying activity designed to demonstrate an Air Systems performance beyond that normally carried out during routine operations and training, whether or not it is performed in front of the public. A Public Display Authority (PDA), Display Authorisation (DA), Foreign Military Display Authority or civilian equivalent is required (except during Display Flying work-up training as per RA 2335(2)). (Display Flying is an activity.) Q3. Will a civilian aircraft, (a VIP visitor, pleasure flight or support aircraft for example) taking off or landing at a MOD aerodrome either before, during or after a Flying Display be required to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit? A3. There is no requirement for a civil user to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit unless the aircraft is conducting Display Flying activity. Therefore, the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes, as set out in JSP 360, should be followed. Q4. Will civilian aircraft participating solely in a static display be required to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit? A4. There is no requirement for a static display aircraft to increase insurance to the £50 million liability limit unless it is conducting Display Flying activity. Therefore, the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes, as set out in JSP 360, should be followed for aircraft involved in static displays. Q5. When a display team, either formation or singleton, performs Display Flying activity, is the £50 million insurance liability limit required for each aircraft, or per display. A5. The display team lead should check with their respective insurer, but aviation liability insurance is normally written on a per aircraft basis for the Flying Display. The key issue is to ensure that the insurance policy is valid and will respond to an incident resulting from each particular Flying Display or Display Flying activity conducted throughout the year.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 360 Part 2.pdf, page 28: ""How the insurance policy is written will very much depend on the frequency of Display Flying activity undertaken by the pilot. Q6. Will the £50 million limit of liability apply to flypasts at Flying Displays for either singleton or formation aircraft? A6. The definition of a flypast in RA 2335 involves Air Systems flying, either singly or in formation, over or past a gathering of spectators along a pre-planned route without manoeuvring, other than when necessary for safe and accurate navigation. Accordingly, they will not include aerobatic manoeuvres. The risk is lower than Display Flying and there would not be a requirement to increase insurance to the £50 million limit of liability. Q7. Does the £50 million limit of liability apply to foreign military registered aircraft conducting Display Flying activity? A7. In the absence of any separate agreement (i.e. NATO Status of Forces Agreement for example) setting out the insurance position, the requirement for the £50 million limit of liability will apply for Display Flying. Q8. Will civilian users at MOD aerodromes or private display clubs require the £50 million limit of liability for practice displays at a MOD aerodrome on a regular or ad hoc basis? A8. MOD Heads of Establishment should assure themselves that practice Display Flying over MOD Occupied Property is conducted in such a way and at such a location as to ensure that Risk to Life is minimised. Where there are no spectators present for practice displays there is no requirement to increase the insurance limit of liability to £50 million. Q9. Is the £50 million limit of liability required for practice Display Flying over MOD occupied property where spectators are present? A9. Yes, because of the increased risk due to the presence of spectators. Q10. Does the £50 million insurance limit of liability apply to Parachute Display activity? A10. No; the risks of injury to spectators are not considered as high in comparison to aircraft Display Flying and the recommended minimum insurance limit of liability is £5M. Q11. Does the £50 million insurance limit of liability apply to civilian Search and Rescue helicopter demonstrations at MOD aerodromes? A11. Yes, there is no varying insurance limit of liability for rotary wing aircraft performing such an activity.""  ', '']"
7,Under what circumstances does the MOD charge other government departments for services?,"The MOD charges other government departments for services in routine situations on a full-cost recovery basis, as per Chapter 1 of JSP 368. However, it may be appropriate to recover less than full cost in some circumstances, such as those involving mutual benefit or humanitarian issues (JSP 368.pdf, page 2, Annex 2.5). Additionally, if the MOD provides assistance during industrial disputes, the use of Service personnel and equipment is authorized under certain regulations, but the Department normally seeks to recover the full cost of this assistance (JSP 368.pdf, page 2, Annex 2.5, v)","['This passage is from JSP 368.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 368 – The MOD Guide to Repayment Chapter 2, Annex 2.5 SPECIAL CHARGING ARRANGEMENTS ii.

Responsibility to agree to the provision of Military Aid to the Civil Community (MACC) Cat A, B and C usually lies with the relevant Director of Resources. Directors of Resources have discretion to set the cost recovery level for such support within the limits of their delegated authority in accordance with Chapter 1 paragraph 39. In all other routine situations, full-cost recovery in accordance with Chapter 1 will be the norm. MAGD iii. Military Aid to other Government Departments (MAGD) is assistance provided by the Armed Forces on “urgent work of national importance”, generally in maintaining supplies and services essential to the life, health and safety of the community. iv. The provision of Military Aid to other Government Departments (MAGD) is a very significant national step and can be undertaken only with specific authorisation of Ministers and the Defence Council and at the specific request of the lead government department. v. Assistance by MOD personnel and equipment may be requested by Other Government Departments (OGDs) to maintain essential services during industrial disputes. Details of the assistance to be provided in any particular set of circumstances are covered in the appropriate Military Aid to other Government Departments (MAGD) Index, which is issued by the Director Counter Terrorism and UK Operations (DCT and UK Ops). The use of Service personnel is authorised under the Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations 1939 and the Emergency Provisions Act 1920 and 1964, which requires a state of emergency to be proclaimed and an Order to be signed by the Defence Council. The Department should normally seek to recover the full cost of assistance provided to Other Government Departments (OGDs) It may, however, be appropriate in some circumstances (e.g. mutual benefit to MOD and Other Government Department (humanitarian related issues etc.) to recover less than full cost in the short term.

From time to time Her Majesty’s ships render assistance to other ships involved in collisions, or wreck, or in distress, or searching for missing ships, if they are in the vicinity and can do so without detriment to their primary tasks. In these circumstances no charges are raised as there is an obligation (United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea and International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) that ships of other nations perform the same service to the UK. 17. If, however, the UK is requested to make vessels available specifically for such purposes by another government department or foreign government, the vessel should be treated as being on loan to the outside body in question, and charges should be raised accordingly. Assistance to HM Revenue & Customs on counter-narcotics tasks is one such example. Charges should be raised on a full-cost recovery basis. Military Aid Overseas Overseas Disaster Relief 18. If military assistance is requested by the Department for International Development (DfID) for relief operations (following natural and man-made disasters overseas), the marginal costs are to be recovered from that Department. Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) of endangered of UK nationals 19. When military assets are used to evacuate Eligible Persons in danger, costs lie where they fall.

Annex B provides guidance weights for lifting and lowering for a fully fit adult; loads that fall within these weights do not normally require a detailed risk assessment to be carried out unless the activity is restricted by one or more of the following factors: a. the nature of the load (hot, cold, shape, size, ease of grip, etc.); b. the task or process involved (twisting or over-reaching, high work frequency and process rates etc); c. the capability of the individual (the ability to carry out manual handling safely varies between individuals; the published guidelines may be exceeded once the risk assessment process has been satisfactorily completed having taken into consideration the individual’s fitness, age, gender, health and / or previous injuries etc.); and d. the working environment (space, lighting, temperature, floor condition, etc.). 13. If in doubt a formal assessment should be carried out.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10.pdf, page 4: ""14. Where the manager is satisfied that no additional risk is present as a result of the above list then there is no requirement to carry out a formal risk assessment. Operations That Will Require a Formal Risk Assessment 15. Where lifting or lowering results in the hands moving out of the zones shown in Annex B, i.e. exceeding the weights stated, a formal risk assessment should be carried out. 16. It should be noted that the purpose of these guideline weights is to avoid wasting time and effort when conducting the risk assessment. They must not be regarded as safe weight limits for lifting. This is because there are too many other factors involved. 17. If a formal risk assessment is required, this should be completed by a competent person in conjunction with the manager and the personnel undertaking the manual handling operation (this can be done using the MOD Form 5012). Assessing the Risk 18. New assessments should be carried out using this guidance (which requires minimal training) and be conducted by ‘competent’ persons who have working knowledge of the processes and activities to be assessed. 19. Assessments should be carried out taking into account gender, age, and health etc. However, there is no need to assess every individual, it is quite acceptable to do a generic assessment that is common to a group of personnel and / or for similar operations. The main point is to identify the risk of injury and highlight how to make practical improvements. 20. Special consideration should be given when lifting operations are to be conducted by young people and new and expectant mothers (see JSP 375 Volume 1, Chapter 19 and 20) with respect to musculoskeletal damage to soft and developing bones / muscles of the individual and the unborn child. For activities or processes that contain a repetitive element, consideration should also be given to the potential for “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” (sore or inflamed joints ((mainly wrists and fingers)), tendon damage, etc). 21. The assessment should consider activities and processes, the environment, the individual and the load as well as the interfaces and accumulative effects of their component parts. Therefore, one of the first assessment activities is to: a. fully identify the task; b. identify the load; c. identify the environment in which the task is to be carried out; d. identify who may be carrying out the task; and e. identify any other factors relevant to task e.g. wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE).""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10.pdf, page 10: ""b. make a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of the risk of injury of any hazardous manual handling operations that cannot be avoided; and c. reduce the risk of injury for operations so far as is reasonably practicable; this can be done by improvements to the task and load (e.g. reduce the load size and / or distance travelled; consider a team load). 35. If an item must be moved, the use of mechanical aids to eliminate the need for manual handling altogether should take primacy; if this option is not reasonably practicable then a review of the task should be undertaken to minimise the need for manual handling (e.g. reducing distance carried from point of delivery to end user). 36. Adequate information, instruction and training should be given in order to undertake the task safely. The type of training could comprise of a combination of the following: a. the “Manual Handling Awareness” course (Defence Learning Environment); b. a video; c. manual handling courses run internally and / or externally; d. on the job training; e. task specific training; and f. refresher training, this must be considered when risk assessments are reviewed. 37. A video must not be used as a substitute for practical instruction but can be used as part of the training package. The correct lifting techniques are illustrated in Annex C. 38. In some instances, there will be resource or other implications (e.g. contractual), which prevent the immediate implementation of control measures. Therefore, the short-term, medium-term and long-term measures should be stated: a. short-term measures may comprise stopping the activity, a briefing in safe lifting techniques, a removal of obstructions; b. medium-term measures could be the provision of mechanical handling aids; and c. longer-term could be the relocation of the storage area due to a unit move or rebuild. 39. Managers are required to demonstrate that they have done all that is “reasonably practicable” in the circumstances to reduce risk, this may be demonstrated by raising any outstanding issues up through the correct Chain of Command.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 10.pdf, page 2: ""operation of supervisors and operators. 5. The manager is responsible for ensuring that assessments are in place and that risk control measures are being adhered to and are continually monitored for effectiveness. Managers are also required to assess the effectiveness of risk control measures and identify any further controls that may be required. This is part of demonstrating all that is “reasonably practicable” to reduce risk has been done, and by raising any outstanding issues up through their correct Chain of Command. Risk Assessors 6. Wherever there is a potential of harm from manual handling activities, the risk should be assessed and evaluated by a competent person3 (in conjunction with the personnel undertaking the activity) who has knowledge of the process / activity, and in what environments the activity is likely to be carried out. If the person assessing the risk is not the manager, they should inform the relevant manager of the findings of the assessment and, if appropriate, explain the risks and the required control measures to manage them.

10,How do I carry out a COSHH risk assessment?,"To carry out a COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) risk assessment, follow these steps as outlined in the provided reference text:

1. Begin with a thorough walk-around observation of all areas and processes in the workplace, including waste storage and disposal systems. Identify all substances directly involved and consider ways to minimize their emission, release, and spread (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 11).
2. Consider all relevant routes of exposure - inhalation, skin absorption, and ingestion - when developing control measures (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 11 & 15).
3. Evaluate the risks using the following priorities: elimination, substitution, hazard control, provision of safety procedures or Safe Systems of Work, and provision of personal protective equipment (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 13).
4. Consult relevant regulations, guidance, and competent persons for assistance when necessary (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, pages 14 & 18).
5. Record significant findings and bring them to the attention of the commander or line manager, along with required control measures (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 20).

Remember that COSHH risk assessments should be carried out for all processes involving hazardous substances, including those in design and development, use, maintenance, storage, and disposal stages. Additionally, consider the risks to vulnerable groups such as pregnant workers and young persons (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 15).

For more detailed information on specific substances like lead and hexavalent chromium, consult additional resources provided in the reference text or Annexes E and F","['This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 11: ""50. Any additional emergency procedures specific to the risk assessment must be clearly documented and recorded on the COSHH assessment form; these are in addition to the existing emergency arrangements. Emergency Services information needs to be building location specific and available out of normal working hours. These may include notification to the local fire service of substances held at the establishment / unit / platform, to aid them in awareness of hazards should they need to attend.  Part 2: Guidance This part provides the guidance and best practice that should be followed using the Plan, Do, Check, Act approach and will help you to keep to this policy. PLAN - identify problems and opportunities 1. Like any health and safety assessment, a COSHH assessment should begin with a thorough walk-around observation of all areas and processes in the workplace, including waste storage and disposal systems (the COSHH Assessment Process Flowchart is at Annex A of this chapter). 2. The requirement following substances directly identified, is to design and operate processes and activities to minimise emission, release and spread of substances hazardous to health, by considering the following: a. consider ways to achieve and maintain control of exposures where prevention is not deemed practicable (decisions should be recorded), e.g. ventilation systems, containment, substituting materials; b. disposal and other similar issues following an incident have been considered and documented; c. this information may also inform the final equipment disposal requirements allowing the risk from such activities to be considered and planned for early on the equipment life cycle; d. identify all potentially exposed groups (including cleaners and maintenance); e. list significant sources of exposure and how people could be exposed; f. reduce number of sources; g. reduce emission rate; h. segregation of large sources; i. enclosure of sources; j. Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV); k. lessons learned, and resultant amended work processes should controls prove inadequate; or l. organise the work to minimise the number of people exposed and the duration, frequency, and level of exposure. 3. Consider all relevant routes of exposure - inhalation, skin absorption and ingestion - when developing control measures, consider the following: a. how does contaminant get into the air? b. how does contaminant get onto skin, eyes, and other soft tissue?""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 15: ""d. a COSHH register will help track items in circulation and assist in stock control and waste management; e. consider storage of items and the control of hazardous substances. A storage plan may be created, and colour coded to assist in segregation of high-risk items, cages and locked cabinets used where required; and f. consider exposure resulting from accidents, incidents, and emergencies. 13. The management of COSHH risks should be controlled using the following in order of priority: a. elimination of the hazard; b. substitution of the hazard (alternative substances or procedures); c. hazard control (e.g. physical protective measures, engineering control); d. provision of safety procedures or Safe Systems of Work; and e. provision of personal and / or respiratory protective equipment. 14. Where substances are purchased from outside the EU or the hazard is a by-product of a process (e.g. fume from welding or wood dust from machining), this information may not be readily accessible (HSE advice sheets cover some processes but not all). In these cases, assistance / advice should be sought from a competent person (e.g. an occupational hygienist) on the properties of the substance or process. It is not acceptable to allow substances or processes into use without proper assessment of the health risks. 15. The assessment should consider all routes by which exposures to hazardous substances may occur (inhalation, skin contact, ingestion, eye contact etc) and under all circumstances, hence assessors should have working knowledge of these processes and activities in order to complete the required ‘suitable and sufficient’ assessment. It should also consider if any end users might be more vulnerable, i.e. pregnant workers, young persons. 16. There are a number of inter-related factors that can affect the risk from exposure: a. the type of damage or harm that the substance can cause, and the amount needed to cause it; b. how much of the substance is likely to be: ingested, get airborne and breathed in, or come into contact with the skin or eyes; c. the duration of exposure and environmental conditions; d. the amount being used and its physical properties i.e. its dustiness or volatility; and e. interaction with other substances (synergistic effects, simultaneous or sequential exposure).""

A storage plan may be created, and colour coded to assist in segregation of high-risk items, cages and locked cabinets must be implemented where required; and f. consider the risk of exposure as recognised in lessons identified from accidents, incidents, and emergencies data. 17. Processes that use or produce hazardous substances must be risk assessed: a. in the design and development process to design out or minimise their use or production; b. when substances (e.g. dust or vapours) result from a process or activity or which arise as a result of an accident or emergency; c. when substances arise as wastes or residues from processes or activities, including scrap material; and d. when substances arise as a result of interaction with another process or activity in the vicinity. 18. A template for a COSHH assessment (MOD Form 5011) and for a COSHH master register (MOD Form 5011a) are available on the Defence Intranet. The use of these templates is optional but should be regarded as the preferred and the minimum information required. Policy Statement 2 The commander or line manager, or accountable person (AP) must make sure that the risks associated with exposure to any substance hazardous to health are evaluated and identify suitable and sufficient control measures, which must be implemented and maintained. 19. Competent persons are required throughout the organisation and must be involved at all stages of managing risk in a process or activity including evaluation and identification of suitable and sufficient control measures. 20. Record the significant findings. The assessor (if not the commander or line manager) should bring the findings of the assessment (taking into account any variation due to local conditions, changes in use and personnel issues and, if appropriate, explain the risks) and the required control measures to manage those risks to the attention of the commander or line manager. The competences required of assessors are described in glossary (Annex D). 21. Risk assessment is not a substitute for making things safe, consider the headings in the order shown according to the hierarchy of risk controls. Do not simply jump to the easiest control measure to implement: a. elimination - redesign the job or substitute a substance so that the hazard is removed or eliminated;""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 3: ""f. any substance that is not classified in the above points but because of its chemical or toxicological properties and the way it is used or is present in the workplace creates a risk to health. 4. Exposure to any substance hazardous to health must be prevented, or where this is not reasonably practicable, a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risk is conducted, and steps taken to meet the requirements of the regulations. Failure to assess the health risks or to prevent exposures where reasonably practicable to do so is a breach of legislation. 5. The activity involving the hazardous substance where personnel may be exposed dictates the need for a risk assessment (not just the presence of the substance), typical activities may include: a. moving / handling; b. transportation (including a Dangerous Goods assessment); c. use; d. maintenance; e. storage; and f. final disposal. 6. Although the use of lead in the workplace can be assessed using the COSHH process, the Control of Lead at Work Regulations (CLAW) specifies its own control requirements that differ slightly to those in the COSHH regulations. One of the control measures specific to CLAW is the need to ensure that, SFAIRP, staff do not eat, drink, or smoke in any place which is, or is liable to be, contaminated by lead. For any COSHH assessment that includes the use of or exposure to lead, the requirements of CLAW must take primacy over those of the COSHH regulations. 7. Hexavalent Chromium (Cr(VI)) can be assessed using the COSHH process, however, the control requirements differ slightly and therefore similar to lead, the management of Cr(VI) in Defence is covered in more detail in Annex E. 8. The additional information with specific emphasis on lead and Hexavalent Chromium are detailed from the perspective; these are known high risk substances which have the potential to have serious health effects were exposure occurs. This does not detract from other substances hazardous to health, e.g. Asbestos and Legionella etc as they must be considered through assessment in accordance with this chapter. 9. The HSE’s COSHH Essentials online tool can be used as an aid in the process of hazardous substance risk assessments. 10. UK HS&EP legislation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) operates alongside COSHH to ensure information on the hazards of chemicals and how to use them safely will be passed down the supply chain by chemical manufacturers and importers through improved Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). This term MSDS is technically still used in legislation e.g. COSHH, however, the term Safety Data Sheet is becoming more commonly referred to by suppliers and is in line with the REACH regulations and as detailed in JSP 515.""

PPE must be left in the workplace where suitable storage and cleaning facilities for PPE are provided. Prescription Safety Eyewear Provision 34. The MOD has signed up to a cross-government Corporate Eyecare Scheme (CES) which also caters for the provision of prescription safety eyewear. Where the provision of prescription safety eyewear is justified (e.g. work requiring a high degree of visual clarity that may be affected by standard eye shields), TLB / business units should have in place procedures for the use of the CES to provide personnel with prescription safety eyewear where it is required. If personnel choose not to use the CES as a matter of preference, they will not be eligible to reclaim any costs for prescription safety eyewear. 35. The CES is accessed through a pre-pay electronic online voucher system which entitles the individual to a pair of prescription safety glasses to the value of: a. £37.00 for single vision safety glasses; and b. £72.00 for bi-focal safety glasses. 36. Note: If the individual wishes to further upgrade from bi-focal to varifocal lenses or to a more expensive frame design, then they will be required to cover any further costs themselves. 37. To order the safety eyewear vouchers an account must first be opened by telephoning Specsavers on 0115 933 0800. Ordering of the vouchers is done online by accessing the account and entering the number of vouchers and type required and paid by GPC card or BACS transfer. Alternatively, a pro-forma invoice for payment can be made by email (uk.corporateeyecare@specsavers.com) or fax (0115 986 1983). 38.

This chapter provides guidance for the provision, management and use of Display Screen Equipment (DSE1) and to enable the assessment and mitigation of the risk of harm from the use of DSE (desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone,) in the work environment (e.g. on the Defence estate or for work purposes; on contractor premises, working from home or working from hotel accommodation etc). This guidance is not limited to typical office situations or computer screens, but also includes laptops, CCTV control rooms, screens used to display line drawings; graphs, charts, radar screens, or computer-  generated graphics, electronic display systems; personal data access (PDA), tablets and smart phones etc. 2. The MOD complies with the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations in its undertakings in Great Britain (GB) and extends the application of the principles so far as is reasonably practicable, to DSE fitted and used within to means of transport (ships and aircraft etc) as well as its undertakings overseas. 3. Within MOD, the term “DSE User” is regarded as anyone who uses DSE for an hour or more on a daily basis. At the discretion of the unit / establishment, local policy may be set to designate any personnel who have access to DSE as a “user” for the purpose of assessment. In a standard office environment, a DSE workstation will comprise of a screen, keyboard, other parts of the computer and its accessories (mouse, or other input device), the work surface (desk), chair and other office furniture as well as the immediate work environment. However other environments may also be classed as DSE workstations e.g. radar operator stations. 4. The main health risks of working with DSE are: a. musculoskeletal disorders e.g. pains in neck, arms, shoulders, back, wrists, fingers, tendons, ligaments, or nerves; b. visual fatigue e.g. eye strain, dry eyes; itching eyes; and 1 Any work equipment having a screen that displays alphanumeric or graphical information regardless of the display process involved (cathode ray tube, liquid crystal, plasma) or any other emerging technologies. This does not include calculators or measurement displays etc""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 12.pdf, page 5: ""24. If personnel know or suspect that they are suffering from a DSE related condition, even after their workstation has been assessed and any necessary corrective action taken, they should inform their manager. 25. The user together with their manager should confirm acceptance of the assessment findings and the recommended actions of completing MOD Form 5016 (DSE user assessment). It is the responsibility of the user to comply with control measures put in place and make any necessary user adjustments to the workstation, taking regular breaks where practicable. Personnel who work from home (classed as ‘Remote Workers’ – see JSP 375 Volume 1 Chapter 21) will need to demonstrate that they know how to set up and assess their own workstation and complete both the workstation (MOD Form 5013) and (MOD Form 5016) the user DSE assessment. 26. Defence personnel may request a regular eyesight test (recommended at two yearly intervals) or if they suspect that they may require spectacles specifically for use with DSE. This should be actioned in accordance with next section of this chapter. DSE Eyesight Tests & Spectacles 27. There is no reliable evidence that work with DSE causes deterioration and / or damage to eyes or eyesight. In the majority of cases DSE users will not need spectacles specifically to work with DSE. The DSE regulations require employers to have in place provision for eyesight testing and if required, spectacles specifically for DSE use; consisting of basic frame and single vision lenses, normally within the 50-60 cm focal range. MOD has no obligation to provide eye tests / corrective spectacles that are required for everyday use. 28. Provision of multifocal lenses (bifocal or varifocal) may be appropriate if it would be impractical for an individual to keep changing their spectacles to perform their DSE related task e.g. where there is a high frequency of change (several times per minute) of focal length to read other text / media or when continually dealing with staff or public whilst using DSE. Corporate Eyecare Scheme(s) (CES) 29. The MOD has signed up to a cross-government Corporate Eyecare Scheme (CES) for the provision of DSE eye-sight tests and spectacles. TLB / business units should have in place procedures for the use of the CES for personnel wishing to take advantage of the MODs legal obligation to provide a free DSE eye-sight test and the provision of spectacles (if required). If personnel choose not to use the CES as a matter of preference, they will not be eligible to reclaim any costs for the DSE eyesight test or spectacles. 30. The CES provides for eye-sight tests and single vision spectacles solely and specifically for DSE use. The CES is accessed through a pre-pay electronic online voucher system.

The use of the CES should result in a reduction of processing paperwork, and therefore, in significant cost savings to Defence over the system of individual reimbursement, whilst providing a wide range of styles and ability for personnel to contribute if they wish to upgrade to designer frames etc. Direct Reimbursement 33. If there is a strong business need for multifocal lenses, an appropriate business case will be required, and authorisation must be obtained using MOD Form 1003 prior to an eyesight test being carried out. A CES voucher should be used for the eyesight test and the direct reimbursement process used to reclaim the full receipted cost up to a maximum contribution of £80 for the spectacles. 34. Where there is no access to a CES outlet (e.g. a Permanent Joint Operating Base overseas), personnel are entitled to use the direct reimbursement process to recover: a. the full cost of a basic DSE eye-sight test fee; and b. the full receipted cost of spectacles up to a maximum contribution of £45 for frames and single vision lenses; or c. the full receipted cost of spectacles up to a maximum contribution of £80 for frames and multifocal lenses (when supported by an appropriate business case). 35.

13,Under what circumstances do I need to conduct health surveillance and monitoring as a line manager?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, health surveillance is necessary when there is a risk of exposure to certain hazardous substances or activities that could lead to work-related disease or ill health (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 25, paragraphs 48 and 54). The line manager should seek occupational health support to establish the most appropriate health surveillance strategy based on the risk assessment. This may include initial and periodic health assessments, regular skin inspections, reporting of symptoms or effects attributable to exposure, seeking an occupational medical opinion when ill-health effects are identified, and ensuring that personnel are informed of the results of any tests and health surveillance data is stored securely (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 25, paragraphs 49-55).

Therefore, as a line manager, you need to conduct health surveillance and monitoring when:

1. Your employees are exposed to certain hazardous substances or activities that could lead to work-related disease or ill health.
2. You have identified a risk assessment that indicates the need for health surveillance.
3. You receive reports of symptoms or effects from your employees that may be attributable to exposure to hazardous substances or activities.

It is important to note that health surveillance and monitoring are legal requirements under COSHH regulations, and failure to comply with these requirements can result in serious consequences for both the employer and the employees.

The need for health surveillance and its extent should be determined as part of the risk assessment, where health surveillance is a separate regulated activity under COSHH (Regulation 11). Its purpose is to identify disease before there is a loss of function (disablement) in any one employee. 49. Where health surveillance is necessary it should be carried out under the direction of a suitably qualified health professional, e.g. occupational health doctor or nurse (where Armed Forces Primary Care have suitably qualified and experienced assets). 50. Appropriate health surveillance may include initial health assessment along with periodic health assessment. Line managers should seek occupational health support to establish the most appropriate health surveillance strategy, suitable for their risk assessment. This will link with exposure monitoring where appropriate. 51. Regular skin inspection of hands and forearms should be carried out by an occupational health professional or, where appropriate, by a suitably trained responsible person (within the workforce). 52. An effective system should be provided for reporting to a responsible person any skin complaint, nasal or respiratory symptoms, or other effects which may be attributable to exposure to Cr(VI) pigments. Care should be taken to respond to reports appropriately and in a timely fashion. 53. An appropriate occupational medical opinion should be sought where ill-health effects are identified, so that prompt remedial action can be taken. 54. Personnel should be informed of the results of any tests for Cr(VI) and the results of any health surveillance. Care should be taken to ensure appropriate information is passed to the employer on a group basis (with individual information passed where appropriate and advised by an occupational health professional cognisant of relevant data protection regulations). Health surveillance data will be stored securely in the appropriate health record (for Service Persons this is the integrated medical record - in Defence Medical Information Capability Programme (DMICP)). 55. Where a suitably qualified health professional reports occupationally attributable health effects related to Cr(VI), the Duty Holder must immediately conduct a risk assessment review (including a review of the effectiveness of all elements in the hierarchy of control) to establish the PAR and that risk is ALARP.

This chapter provides guidance on the management of Occupational Health Surveillance (HS) and Occupational Health Monitoring (HM). Both HS and HM are led by Occupational Medical professionals (in industrial medicine (at work) or public medicine (control of disease and preventative medicine)). The links with occupational health and safety are concerned with the effects to the long-term health of the individual from their work and workplace; and the effects that their health may have on their work, sometimes linked to chronic conditions or exposure to substances or industrial practices harmful to humans (see also JSP 418). Health surveillance and health monitoring are medical services that offer tools to identify work-related disease or ill health to help minimise the effects to help the management of the health risks. The connection between cause and effect of work-related ill health is not always obvious; it can often take some time for symptoms to develop. For some personnel, a health issue will affect their ability to work or the type of work they can do. In other cases, the work itself may have the potential to affect a person’s health. 2. The majority of MOD civilians in the UK will receive their Occupational Health (OH) from the OH service provider via DBS People Services, according to their role. In some cases, civilian personnel may receive some OH services from military establishment and its medical facilities if they are based on those establishments and necessary arrangements are in place. 3. Service personnel will receive their OH nursing and occupational medicine support from military establishment medical centres. The arrangements for Service personnel to access OH services are contained in Single and Joint Service instructions and publications. 4. Wherever these services are available to civilian or military personnel, it is incumbent on those service providers and local management to ensure there are effective arrangements in place to deliver adequate support, adequate record keeping and information exchange across disciplines, underpinned by legal duties of care as well as forming part of employment terms and conditions.  5. HS is legally required for personnel with significant risk of exposure to certain hazards associated with a work activity1 e.g. asbestos, lead, noise or vibration, diving, working in compressed air atmosphere, welding, ionising radiation and some solvents, fumes, dusts, biological agents and other substances hazardous to health which are linked with a known health condition.

14,How do I test the fit of respiratory protective equipment?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, fit testing for respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is required for each type of tight-fitting RPE used by an individual to ensure a correctly fitting facepiece that matches the person's facial features and provides an adequate seal (Annex A, Guideline 1). The fit test should be conducted by a competent person who has adequate knowledge, instruction, and training in various aspects of RPE, including the purpose and applicability of fit testing, preparation of facepieces for fit testing, interpretation of fit test results, and understanding of different protection factors (Annex A, Guideline 3). The manager is responsible for ensuring that appropriate fit testing is conducted by a competent person and the assessment is recorded (Chapter 15, Paragraph 48). If there are significant changes to an individual's face or head that may affect the seal of the RPE, a repeat fit test will be required (Annex A, Guideline 51). Fit test records must be kept by the manager for at least five years and made available to the HSE on request (Chapter 15, Paragraph 52). If there is a failure of correctly fitted RPE, the incident should be investigated, and the individual may need to be referred to occupational health for medical advice (Chapter 15, Paragraph 53). Personnel who are required to wear RPE must complete a MOD Form 5032 – Self-Assessment, and if a positive response to one or more questions is obtained, the manager will refer the individual to occupational health for assessment (Chapter 15, Paragraph 54).

For Service personnel, mental wellbeing is managed in accordance with the Armed Forces Mental Health Strategy. Additionally, managers should arrange for a return to work plan for staff returning after prolonged absence or following stress-related illness, which may include phased returns, amended duties, altered hours, and workplace adaptations (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 17, page 6). Managers are also encouraged to discuss issues that may be stress related with Defence personnel and offer appropriate support.

Further advice is available from the NHS and HSE stress websites on identifying and managing stress (the Defence modified HSE Management Standards Indicator Tool is built around a participatory approach). The HSE also offers a Line Manager Competency Indicator Tool to help managers reflect on their own behaviour and management style as these factors play an important role in preventing and reducing workplace stress. 23. At the workplace level, high levels of absenteeism and accidents (including minor ones) are often linked to stress. Low production levels, poor quality output and difficult inter-personal relationships may also be associated with stress. Other situational indicators include: a. working long hours; b. insufficient work; c. job insecurity; d. organisational change; e. short conflicting deadlines; f. quantitative and qualitative work overload; g. loss of concentration; h. irritability and aggression; and i. an increase in musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. back ache). 24.

The pressure encountered in everyday life; at home, at work and from exposure to traumatic situations, may impact resilience in physical and / or mental health. The effective management of stress and welfare in the workplace is essential for the maintenance of good levels of mental and physical health and maintaining the Defence capability. 2. The MOD believes that its personnel are its most important asset and that their wellbeing is essential to effective work performance and the provision of high-quality services. To this end the MOD is committed to promoting a healthy and supportive environment in which to operate and recognises the importance of identifying, reducing and managing stress: in the workplace; in training; and on operations. 3. Stress affects people in different ways at different times and is often the result of a combination of factors in their personal and working lives. Work related stress arises where the combination of pressure from workload, working practices, work relationships, etc. exceeds the persons capacity and capability to cope resiliently, resulting in adverse physical and / or mental reactions. 4. Whilst the MOD has no direct control over external or personal factors, it is committed to manage those risks factors which are within its control to minimise their impact, where possible. The MOD is committed to enhancing the wellbeing of Defence personnel through a range of measures to help understand and recognise the causes of stress. The measures led by Defence personnel include personnel development, improved HR procedures and support. Collectively, with physical and mental resilience and mental first-aid, each measure should encourage the active management of workplace stress and promote a good work-life balance. 5. Like any other employer in Great Britain, the MOD must identify and prevent or reduce the causes of work-related stress, in accordance with its legal duties1, 1 These include The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Section 3; The Working Time Regulations 1998; Safety representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 (SRSCR 1977); Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and Race Relations Act 1976.

Notably, an article from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2001 showed that 84 employees were taking legal action against British Telecom (BT) claiming to suffer from health problems because of acoustic shock at work (‘British Broadcasting Company, “Legal Action Over \'Acoustic Shock\',” BBC, 12 February 2001. [Online]. Available: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1165366.stm’). BT has paid approximately £90,000 in compensation to one worker. 10. Defence personnel at particular risk of acoustic shock and startle are those performing tasks requiring high levels of concentration whilst operating such telecommunication hardware, for example radar operators, sonar operators, call operators, radio operators and interpreters. The potential risk from use of tactical hearing protection with in-built communications capability, is unclear, but should be assumed as a possible risk. 11. Measures to limit the risk of acoustic shock from occurring, or the subsequent acoustic startle, should include: a. make sure headsets have acoustic limiting capabilities, either built-in or as an add-on; b. make sure work pace and demands are not causing physical or mental stress; c. rotating personnel on activities which use earphone hardware; d. encouraging frequent rest breaks; and e. mental and physical stress management and reduction techniques. 12. Personnel using such earphone hardware should be informed of the potential risk. Further, these personnel should be encouraged to report any acoustic shock events and / or symptoms. 13. All incidents of acoustic shock and acoustic startle should be recorded in line with accident and incident reporting procedures as per JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 16 - ‘Accident / Incident Reporting and Investigation’. 14. If symptoms are noticed staff should request referral to their Occupational Health provider (Service Medical Officer / or Defence Business Services (DBS) Civilian Human Resources (CHR) for civilians). The commander, manager or accountable person who is responsible for that person must action such requests and if more than one person in a team is reporting similar incidents, the commander, manager or accountable person should request further advice from their Occupational Health provider. Use of personal audio systems 15. The use of personal audio systems (for example MP3 players and personal stereos) may pose a risk to effective communications or may prevent the correct wearing of PPE. This may contribute to exposure above the EAVs in the legislation. It is therefore suggested that personal audio systems at work should not be allowed by default, except where personnel are off-duty / not at work.""  ', '']"
17,Are my staff allowed to work alone in the office after other people have gone home?,"According to the provided reference text, lone working is an option for office work as long as it has been approved by commanders, managers, and APs after a suitable risk assessment has been conducted. However, employers are required to manage any health and safety risks before allowing staff to work alone (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 18, page 5). Therefore, the answer is: Yes, but only if it has been approved through a risk assessment process.

Commanders, managers and APs must define the limits of what can and cannot be done whilst working alone and specify how and when the lone worker is to stop work or seek advice in circumstances which are new, unusual or beyond the scope of their competency. 13. When planning lone working activities, commanders, managers and APs must take into account the views of the personnel who will be conducting the work. 14. Not all work can be conducted alone, there may be practical reasons where the activity requires more than one person, such as manual handling activities. In some higher-hazard activities such as, work in confined spaces or diving operations, legislation requires that at least two or more employees must be engaged. Therefore, lone working is not an option. Commanders, managers and APs must therefore make sure that lone working is an option before approving a lone working activity. Health and safety advisers can be consulted to provide help and guidance on the management of high-hazard activities. Policy Statement 2 Commanders, managers and APs must make sure that appropriate risk assessment is carried out and recorded if lone working is planned or identified and must, so far as is reasonably practicable, make sure that lone workers are not placed at greater risk due to them working alone. 15. Commanders, managers and APs must identify hazards and the risks that may arise and decide whether reasonable steps are being taken to manage them. This must be done by undertaking suitable and sufficient risk assessment (JSP 375, Volume 1 Chapter 8 - Safety risk assessment and safe systems of work) following the five-step risk assessment process: a. Step 1 – Identify the hazards; b. Step 2 – decide who might be harmed and how; c. Step 3 – evaluate the risks and identify suitable and sufficient control measures; d. Step 4 – record and implement findings; and e. Step 5 – review the risk assessment and update as necessary. 16. Those undertaking the risk assessment must be competent and must engage with the personnel who are conducting the work activity to make sure all hazards are suitably identified; safe working practices are effective and control measures are workable. 17. The findings of the risk assessment and any control measures implemented must be communicated to all personnel engaged in or affected by the activity. 18. Commanders, managers and APs must be satisfied that the control measures are effective, suitable and clearly communicated to all affected personnel, fully implemented, maintained and used properly. The person conducting the lone working activity must be competent to do so.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 18.pdf, page 1: ""Part 1: Directive Introduction 1. This chapter sets out the direction and guidance on the health and safety issues related to Defence personnel working alone. A lone worker is a person who undertakes a specific activity unaccompanied or without immediate access to another person for assistance. It is not where individuals experience brief situations in which they find themselves alone, but where individuals are knowingly placed in circumstances where they work without supervision or immediate access to others. Background 2. Resource limitations and efficiency drives along with advances in telecommunications and information technology, has resulted in more activities potentially being carried out by lone workers. Lone workers may be exposed to greater risks than those conducting similar tasks as part of a team or under supervision. It is important therefore to identify Defence personnel who are lone workers, make sure there is awareness of the potential hazards and for the risks involved to be appropriately managed. 3. Employers are required to manage any health and safety risks before people can work alone. This requirement is covered by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 4. Lone workers are not to be placed at greater risk due to them working alone and if the risk assessment shows that it is not possible for the work to be done safely by a lone worker, then other arrangements must be put in place. 5. In addition to the practical reasons why lone working may not be possible, there may also be legislation that requires certain activities to be undertaken by more than one person, for example higher-hazard activity such as working in confined spaces, diving operations, and so on, therefore lone working is not an option. In the event you are unsure if lone working is possible, legal or health and safety advice should be sought. Key health and safety legislation 6. Employers have a general duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HSWA) to maintain safe working arrangements for their employees. There is a further duty on employers under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to carry out a risk assessment of the hazards to which their employees are exposed. 7.

The types of record which this provision relates to include any documentation completed during normal reporting procedures which confirms that the incident took place or medical treatment was administered, including records held electronically. These can include details from Incident Notification Cells, road traffic accident reports, hospital case notes, data obtained from the Defence Medical Information Capability Programme and GP notes. 2.43. For dates covered by the AFCS, Service personnel have an obligation to report incidents. All three Services have accident notification cells and reporting chains. If a report of the incident was not created at the time, the Service person could reasonably be asked if he or she has a credible reason for not filing a report. If no such reason is forthcoming, then it may be assumed the incident did not necessarily take place as claimed. 2.44. Where there is reliable evidence that an incident occurred in the circumstances described by the individual, this does not necessarily mean that any injury arising from that incident is deemed to be caused by service. The material fact to which the missing record relates will be decided in the individual’s favour, not necessarily the whole claim. For example, if the individual states that they broke their leg at an approved sports event and there is other evidence that the injury occurred but the Army file relating to the incident has been lost, DBS will presume that the individual did in fact break their leg at the event. If, for example, further evidence demonstrates that the individual was at the event as a spectator only and in a capacity unrelated to their own service, and was not participating in a sport activity, the individual will not receive compensation. Illness Caused by Service 2.45. Claims for illnesses including physical and mental health disorders are treated in exactly the same way as claims for injuries. The Services and all Defence organisations, including DMS and Defence Community Mental Health teams (DCMH), provide the supporting information to enable DBS to make evidence-based decisions.

1. Identifying problems and opportunities, planning for adequate resources, and reviewing and amending plans as necessary (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 9).
2. Ensuring appropriate training on good DSE workstation set-up, safe practices for manual handling, risk assessment, personal safety issues, and the ""softer aspects"" of working remotely or in isolation (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 9).
3. Establishing methods to keep in touch with remote personnel through regular online catch-up meetings or face-to-face visits when necessary (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 11).
4. Ensuring that health and safety policies for computers and laptops are followed, including conducting DSE assessments where necessary (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 11).
5. Conducting workplace checks, either through self-assessment checklists or on-site visits when required (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 11).
6. Encouraging work-life balance and regular breaks, as well as ensuring that employees are not working longer hours than necessary or feeling obligated to answer emails outside of normal working hours (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 11).
7. Providing clear emergency procedures and contact information for remote workers (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 11).
8. Ensuring that lone working risks are effectively managed (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 8).
9. Monitoring the health, safety, and welfare of remote employees through regular engagement and reviewing risk assessments (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 21, page 8).

PLAN - identify problems and opportunities Policy Statement 1 Commanders, managers and Accountable Persons (APs) have the same health, safety and welfare responsibilities for all Defence personnel (irrespective of the location at which they work, whether at home or other locations) and must make sure that appropriate furniture, equipment and services are provided to those who work remotely. 1. All remote working should be adequately planned to make sure all policy requirements are effectively met, reviewed and amended where necessary. 2. Not all work can be effectively conducted remotely, some locations might not be suitable for remote working and not all personnel are able to work remotely. Commanders, managers and APs should talk with personnel to identify any concerns or issues that may impact remote working. If remote working is not possible or not considered appropriate, commanders, managers or APs should agree alternative arrangements for people to work in their parent organisation’s establishment, unit or site or seek alternative suitable premises. 3. For Defence personnel working remotely from their management, additional training may be required such as; understanding good DSE workstation set-up, safe practices for manual handling, risk assessment and personal safety issues. The ‘softer aspects’ of working remotely or in isolation also need to be addressed, for example being self-  disciplined, planning the day, managing time, communicating with managers and peers. Without training and support these issues could lead to increased work-related stress problems. 4. In some situations, it may be more practical to train Defence personnel who work remotely to conduct their own risk assessments, DSE assessments, manual handling assessments etc. so that they become a competent assessor. In these circumstances the effectiveness and accessibility of training should be considered as remote working may make attending full-time training courses more difficult. Use of on-line or e-courses should be considered where appropriate and available. 5. Where Defence personnel are based at another Government department or Defence establishment, unit or site or in commercial premises, a formal agreement or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) should be in place. This should detail safety responsibilities, occurrence reporting procedures and how health, safety and welfare problems should be resolved.""

Health and wellbeing - People who are deprived of social contact through work can feel isolated or disconnected, bringing on pressure and stress or aggravating pre-existing mental health problems. Commanders, managers and APs should establish how to keep in touch with their remote working personnel e.g. regular online catch-up meetings or where necessary and practical, face to face visits. d. Computers and laptops - Defence use of computers and laptops comes under the policy and guidance contained in JSP 375 Vol 1 Chapter 12 (Display Screen Equipment) and requires commanders, managers and APs to make sure an assessment is conducted where DSE is used for an hour or more on a daily basis. Where people are working from home, it may be beneficial to train those personnel to competently conduct their own DSE assessment. e. Workplace checks - In most cases remote working site visits are not required. However, visits might be necessary: (1) to meet any special requirement, such as for a worker with a disability; or (2) if the work activity includes any significant hazards like tools or chemicals. Use of self-assessment checklists can be an effective way of checking safety without the need for site visits. However, they have limitations and should only be used where the risk is low. If self-assessment and or questionnaires are to be used, their format, training requirements and management should be included within the risk assessment. The checklists at Annex A and B can be used to help identify potential hazards and risks. Checklist B can also be adapted to provide confirmation that safety controls are in place. f. Work / life balance - Those working remotely, especially at home, can sometimes work longer hours, making them tired and stressed. Commanders, managers and APs should speak regularly about workloads, demands and training needs. Remote workers should be encouraged to take regular breaks and use their annual leave. Commanders, managers and APs should make sure people are not working too long to meet unrealistic deadlines or feel obliged to answer emails outside normal working hours. g. Emergencies - Commanders, managers and APs should make sure remote workers know what to do in an emergency. Emergency procedures should include guidance on how and when remote workers should contact their commanders, managers or APs, including details of any emergency contact numbers. Consideration should be given to what action should be taken if a remote worker cannot be contacted, e.g. the holding of emergency contact details for the remote worker. h.

Each year many people die from electric shock or from burns received from an electric shock at work. An electrical accident may result in a fatal electric shock, serious injury, or a major fire affecting the whole premises. Most electrical accidents occur because people are working on or near electrical equipment: a. that is thought to be dead, but which is still live; b. that is known to be live but those involved do not have adequate training and / or experience; c. with a lack of supervision and / or poor planning; d. when using equipment that is not appropriate; or e. knowingly taking unnecessary risks (e.g. not following a Safe System of Work or permit to work). 6. A significant percentage of fires on the Defence estate are either started by electrical faults or the misuse of electricity. Fires may be started by: a. overheating of electrical equipment / systems due to overloading; b. the failure of electrical equipment; c. the leakage of electrical current due to poor, inadequate or faulty insulation; d. overheating of materials placed too close to electrical equipment which is otherwise operating normally; and e. the ignition of materials in the vicinity of electrical equipment caused by arcing or sparking. 7. Nearly a quarter of all reportable electrical accidents in the UK involve portable equipment; for which poor maintenance is a major cause. The recommended maintenance strategy is based on a straightforward, inexpensive system of visual inspection that can be undertaken by any member of staff; the HSE have estimated that around 95% of faults or damage could be identified this way. 8. The management use and maintenance of electrical equipment / systems by Defence personnel and on Defence premises / equipment must be carried out in compliance with the Electricity at Work Regulations or the Merchant Shipping (Guarding of Machinery and Safety of Electrical Equipment) Regulations as appropriate. 9.

It outlines how MOD must comply with statute within GB and how it shall apply safe systems of work worldwide. 2. In addition to the guidance contained in this chapter, any activity which may expose personnel to live electrical conductors above Extra Low Voltage (ELV) (over 50 volts AC or 120 volts DC) or in high risk environments is subject to JSP 375, Volume 3 which includes instruction on High Voltage (HV) and amplifies the Chapters of Volume 1. This chapter should be read in conjunction with other JSPs, ISO-British Standards, and Defence Standards that contain requirements for electrical safety. 3. There are many sources of electrical energy within the workplace, from small batteries in electronic systems, through power distribution systems at ELV, low voltage (LV), high voltage (HV) and up to static electricity and lightning. Variations in the voltage, current and the frequency of the electricity affects the way in which the electrical energy will act, but basically there are common dangers associated with all the different forms of electricity. 4. The dangers from electricity include the risk of electrical burns, electric shock and electrocution. A person forming a path for an electrical current to flow will suffer an electric shock or burn. The severity being dependent on the nature of the electricity, the duration of the contact, the amount of current which flows and the route it takes as it passes through the body. Susceptibility to electric shock is increased if a person is in good electrical contact with earth. This should be taken into account when using electricity in damp / wet conditions or in conducting locations such as inside a metal tank. 1 “electrical systems” means an arrangement of devices that an electric current can flow through when connected to a power source. 2 SI-1998-494, The Health and Safety (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 1998.""

The Lower Exposure Action Values (LEAV), Upper Exposure Action Values (UEAV) and Exposure Limit Values (ELV) for daily or weekly personal noise exposure and peak sound pressure are presented in the table below1. Lower Exposure Action Values (LEAV) Upper Exposure Action Values (UEAV) Exposure Limit Values (ELV) Daily or weekly personal noise exposure 80 dB(A-weighted) 85 dB(A-weighted) 87 dB(A-weighted) Peak sound pressure 135 dB(C-weighted) 137 dB(C-weighted) 140 dB(C-weighted) Table A-1 Noise exposure action and limit values 2. The daily or weekly personal noise LEAVs, UEAVs and ELVs presented above are time weighted average noise exposure levels. This means they are calculated from the average sound pressure level, for example 80 dB(A), and the time over which personnel are exposed to that average sound pressure level, for example 8 hours per working day. 3. As per the legislation, the values presented in the table above are shown for a nominal 8 hour working day or a nominal 40 hour working week2 3. This means that if an individual were exposed to an average of 80 dB(A) for 8 hours in a day, or for 40 hours in a week, then their personal exposure has reached the LEAV. Similarly, if an individual was exposed to an average of 85 dB(A), or 87 dB(A) for those same times, their personal exposure has reached the UEAV and ELV respectively. 4. The peak sound pressure values refer to any maximum sound pressure received which is typically from loud, impact type noises, for example explosions or percussive tools. The concept of the time weighted average noise exposure level is explained in the sections below. 1 The thresholds are presented in the logarithmic decibel (dB) scale. Decibels are typically rounded to the nearest whole number or presented to no more than 1 decimal place. The levels are ‘A-weighted’ (dB(A)) or ‘C-weighted’ (dB(C)). These weightings are outlined in ‘BS EN 6167201:2013 Electroacoustics. Sound level meters. Specifications’ ‘BSI,2013’. 2 The Legislation is based on a worker being exposed to workplace noise for 8 hours a day or for 40 hours per week. This definition has significant implications for Defence personnel who may be in a ‘workplace’ for 24 hours per day for 7 days per week, requiring a significant reduction in the average noise level to which they can be exposed before reaching the Action Values or Limit Values. 3 If the noise level to which an individual is exposed varies significantly over a working week, then the average over the week can be used, rather than the average over a single working day.""

Additionally, all vibration risk assessments must be regularly reviewed and updated if there are any changes to the activity or an increase in the risk of exposure to harmful vibration levels (Policy Statement 5, Step 5 - Review the vibration risk assessment and update if necessary). The initial review should take place no longer than 3 months after the detailed vibration risk assessment is completed, with periodic reviews at a frequency based on the change of risk but normally not exceeding every two years.

Initial vibration risk assessment 1. The first step is to ascertain whether a vibration hazard is present. This is determined by completing the Vibration Hazard Check Questionnaire (VHCQ) in Annex C. The results of the VHCQ will determine whether a detailed vibration risk assessment is required. The VHCQ can be conducted by a commander, manager or accountable person and/or personnel familiar with the work environments and processes that generate vibration.11 2. If the VHCQ indicates that there is a potential vibration exposure problem a detailed vibration risk assessment is required. This should be undertaken in conjunction with MOD Form 5051 and MOD Form 5054. These forms should be referenced on the detailed vibration risk assessment as per Chapter 8 of JSP 375, Volume 1. 3. As an approximate guide, a detailed vibration risk assessment is likely to be necessary for: a. any proposed work activity where vibration exposure at a ‘notable level’ will be physically experienced at the hand for HAV or at the feet, buttocks or back for WBV; b. personnel will be operating or riding in Armoured vehicles (tracked and wheeled) and other tracked vehicles on or off-road, or wheeled vehicles off-road; c. personnel will be operating or riding in fast boats or in vehicles or equipment of any nature on or off road for example; B vehicles, AFV, C vehicles, plant and equipment, tracked or wheeled. d. Aircrew and passengers; and e. personnel with any prior vibration induced symptoms or who are medically susceptible. 4. It is difficult to define a ‘notable or significant’ vibration level that can be accurately judged by a non-expert. If in doubt, then initiate a detailed vibration risk assessment. However, a notable or significant vibration level may be present if: a. the vibration causes any sensation other than one where you simply ‘feel’ the vibration (for example, tingling, numbness, blurred vision, pain); b. the vibration feels greater than you would expect sat in a motorcar driving on maintained roads; c. the vibration causes fastenings (for example nuts and bolts) to loosen; and d. the vibrating surface can be seen to vibrate with the naked eye. 11 Note that certain questions in the VHCQ may require answers that are medically confidential, and such confidentiality must be respected, whilst making sure that appropriate risk factors are highlighted.""

If a suitable ‘in-house’ CP is not immediately available, then timely action is required to source an external CP. It is suggested that no more than 3 months is allowed between the determination of a need for the detailed vibration risk assessment and its execution. In the case where extreme vibration levels or repeated shock is anticipated, then the relevant activity should not be undertaken until the detailed vibration risk assessment has been completed. 7.

For example: a. new vibrating equipment has been introduced, or other changes to the vibration levels are suspected; b. there are reports of vibration induced damage or harm; c. after an accident or near-miss where vibration could have been a contributory factor to the accident; d. a change in the point of application of the vibration to the body or the duration of exposure; and e. if there is any reason to suspect that the current detailed vibration risk assessment in no longer valid. 34. It is imperative that personnel at all levels across Defence learn from any accidents or incidents, ill health data, errors or relevant experience gained in the carrying out of their duties. Such incidents must be documented in the relevant risk assessment and controlled through the adoption of engineering and management control measures.

27,What is the minimum height that counts as 'working at height'?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 27.pdf (page 1), working at height is defined as ""any activity in any place above, at or below ground level, including obtaining access or egress (except by staircase) from such a place, that if there were no precautions in place, a person or item could fall a distance liable to cause personal injury."" Therefore, there is no specific minimum height mentioned in the text for what counts as 'working at height.' However, it's important to note that falls from other than high places are also recognized as a risk and should be managed appropriately.

If working at height is unavoidable, reasonably practicable measures must be implemented to prevent falls of persons and / or falling objects or where the risk cannot be eliminated, to minimise the distance and the consequences of the fall. 8. Where an activity carried out in the interests of national security cannot comply with any of the WAHR, an exemption case specific to the activity for a person or class of persons to be exempted from the relevant part(s) of the regulation(s) will be required to be submitted to the relevant Defence Regulatory Authority domain; (land, maritime, air) for consideration.

Managers are to ensure that all potential activity which may require working at height within their area of responsibility is identified and appropriate measures are undertaken to ensure safety of personnel and visitors. Where working at height cannot be avoided, the manager responsible for the activity or for the management of contractors carrying out the activity must ensure that a suitable and sufficient risk assessment (JSP 375 Volume 1 Chapter 8) is conducted in consultation with personnel who are familiar with the activity and who are competent to undertake the work. 15. The control hierarchy3 when planning any working at height activities is: a. avoid working at height - so far as is reasonably practicable work should be conducted at ground level; b. prevent falls – where working at height cannot be avoided, prevent falls using an existing safe place of work or use the correct type of equipment. A safe place of work may need to be created if none exists (e.g. using temporary guard rails around a roof, or by providing a correctly constructed scaffold); c. minimise the distance and consequence of a fall - so far as is reasonably practicable, to provide the right type of work equipment to minimise the distance and consequences of a fall. (e.g. the distance that a person can fall can be reduced with safety nets or fall arrest systems); d. reduce time spent required to be at height - co-ordination of maintenance needs can combine several small maintenance jobs together; and e. training and instruction - ensure where working at height is undertaken that all such work is to be appropriately planned (including selection of work equipment) and supervised and that this work is conducted by suitable and sufficiently competent personnel. 16.

It is falls from other than high places that are often overlooked due to the smaller distances involved and the risk of serious injury is therefore not always appreciated. Falls of relatively short distance are often overlooked in the activity risk assessment as they are considered incidental to the main task. 6. The risk of falls, regardless of the distance, can have serious consequences depending on what the person or object falls onto / into. Falls remain the single biggest cause of workplace deaths and one of the main causes of major injury. The ideal method of preventing a fall from height is to remove the need for working at height. The challenge is to change the thinking and consequent behaviour and reduce the likelihood of that one act or slip which could end in tragedy; correct planning and suitable training of Defence personnel is essential to meeting this aim. Examples of work activities that are classified as working at height may include: a. working on aircraft; b. unloading and loading of vehicles (e.g. refilling tankers, using loading bays); c. maintenance of vehicles and equipment; d. working on a roof; e. erecting falsework and formwork; f. using a ladder or stepladder; g. working at ground level adjacent to an open excavation, pit or hole; h. working within an excavation, pit or hole; i. working on, or erecting scaffolding; j. infrastructure maintenance tasks (for example, changing lights or ceiling tiles in an office); k. working near or adjacent to fragile material (e.g. sky lights); l. work on a “deck”2 in the Maritime and Air environment; and m. climbing into or out of a vehicle. 2 Ground level equates to “Deck” in the Maritime and Air environment""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 27.pdf, page 1: ""27 Preventing Falls and Falling Objects Contents Title Page Introduction 1 Roles and Responsibilities 3 Exemptions 7 Retention of Records 8 Related Documents 9 Introduction 1. This chapter provides guidance for compliance with the Work at Height Regulations (WAHR) and the safe management of Defence activities in order to prevent / reduce the risk of falls of personnel or equipment from height that is liable to cause personal injury; and how the roles and responsibilities are attributed within Defence. The scope extends to any foreseeable risk of falls from height involving Defence assets or the Defence estate including unauthorised parties gaining access to areas with significant risks of falls; sheer drops, unguarded fixed access ladders etc. 2. This chapter does not cover Defence personnel responsible for planning, supervising or undertaking work at height on designated Restricted High Places (RHPs)1, these shall be managed in accordance with JSP 375, Volume 3. This chapter does not apply to undertaking Adventurous Training (e.g. caving, climbing) for which Service specific policies and nationally accepted good practice shall be followed, however, it does apply to the maintenance or modification of high ropes course, route setting on climbing walls etc. 3. For the purpose of Defence activities, the definition of working at height is: “any activity in any place above, at or below ground level, including obtaining access or egress (except by staircase) from such a place, that if there were no precautions in place, a person or item could fall a distance liable to cause personal injury”. 4. The risk of falls from high places (e.g. into a pit or excavation, from a ship mast, or from a roof) or objects falling on to people below is generally obvious and the need for managing this activity is easily recognised. However, it is the falls from other than high places that are not so easily recognised these may include: a. ladders, steps etc.; b. road vehicles; 1 RHPs are, for example, masts, towers and other buildings, plant rooms and installations including work platforms with permanent fixed access systems such as fixed ladders, step-irons, etc. A mast or tower structure which does not have a fixed access system but is climbable by using its lattice frame may also to be designated as an RHP.

Some of the above conditions may already be present; however, some may arise through the work being carried out or due to nearby activities. Roles and Responsibilities Commanding Officer (CO) / Head of Establishment (HoE) 8. The CO / HoE should ensure that all confined spaces within their area of responsibility are identified, recorded in a register, risk assessed, and access controlled. This may include the use of a permit to work system see JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 30 (Permit to Work) or JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6 (Work in Confined Spaces). All procedures are to be audited regularly to ensure compliance and action taken immediately to correct any failures. Managers 9. Managers should ensure that all tasks / activities carried out in confined spaces under their control are risk assessed (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 8), Safe Systems of Work are implemented and that relevant Permits to Work are raised (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 30). Suitable and sufficient assessments of risk to persons, either directly or indirectly employed and to others who may become involved in the treatment or safe evacuation of personnel from within the confined space.

Assessing and Managing the Risk Avoiding Confined Space Working 11. Entry or work in confined spaces is to be avoided unless it has been determined that there is no reasonably practical alternative. 12. If the intended work is unavoidable the following should be considered: a. modification of the confined space so that entry is not necessary; b. have the work done from outside, e.g. inspection; sampling and cleaning operations can sometimes be done from outside the space using appropriate intrinsically safe equipment and tools; and c. intrinsically safe remote cameras may be used for internal inspection of confined spaces. Risk Assessment 13. If confined space working cannot be avoided, line managers should carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of the activity (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 8). For work in confined spaces this means identifying the hazards present, who will be exposed to the hazards, assessing the risks and determining what precautions to take. The assessment should include consideration of: a. the normal hazards associated with the task or activity; b. the working environment (lighting levels, cramped conditions, etc.); c. if access is needed to be controlled with standing instructions or a Permit-  to-work (PTW). d. working materials and intrinsically safe tools; e. the suitability and competence of those carrying out the task or activity; f. communications; and g. arrangements for emergency rescue. 14. When assessing and planning work involving confined spaces the following should be considered prior to the start of work.

This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance for the management of confined spaces. For MOD infrastructure projects specific additional requirements are specified in JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6 (which amplifies this chapter) in accordance with statutory requirements. 2. JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6 does not apply to military training conducted on the Defence estate that involves confined spaces, however, co-operation and co-  ordination will be required between those organising the training and those with responsibility for the control of the confined spaces. 3. A confined space can be any space which is substantially but not always entirely enclosed where there is a risk of death or serious injury from hazardous substances or dangerous conditions, e.g. a lack of oxygen. A significant number of people are killed or seriously injured in confined spaces each year in the UK. Those killed include not only people working in the confined space but those who try to rescue them without proper training and / or equipment. 4. Some confined spaces are fairly easy to identify, e.g. enclosures with limited openings: a. storage tanks; b. sewers, tunnels and pipes; c. some machinery spaces; d. trenches and pits; and e. ships compactors and ballast tanks. 5. Other confined spaces may be less obvious, but can be equally dangerous, e.g. unventilated or poorly ventilated work spaces. Some places may become confined spaces when work is carried out, or during their construction, fabrication or subsequent modification.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 28.pdf, page 6: ""Provision of Ventilation 25. When assessing the levels of ventilation required, consideration should be given to the work activity to be performed and the equipment used as they will have an impact on the rate of oxygen usage and possible build-up of toxic atmospheres. If it is not possible to increase the number of openings and therefore improve ventilation, mechanical ventilation may be necessary to ensure an adequate supply of fresh air. This is essential where portable gas cylinders and diesel fuelled equipment are used inside the space because of the dangers from build-up of engine exhaust. Carbon monoxide in the exhaust from petrol-fuelled engines is so dangerous that use of such equipment in confined spaces should never be allowed. Provision of Breathing Apparatus 26. If the air inside the confined space cannot be made fit to breathe because of lack of oxygen or the presence of gas, fumes or vapours; positive pressure air fed masks should be used (see JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 15). Isolation of Equipment and Services 27. If there is the potential for gas, fumes, liquid or vapour etc to be released into the confined space, the physical isolation of services etc should be a requirement of the PTW. In all cases a check should be made to ensure isolation is effective and does not compromise any safety critical systems. Cleaning Confined Spaces Before Entry 28. If the risk assessment identifies that there is a risk of flammable / toxic gases or vapours etc being released in a confined space by the disturbance of residues etc., while a task or activity is being undertaken, the confined space should where practicable, be cleaned prior to any person entering into it. Provision of Rescue Harnesses 29. Where the requirement to wear safety harnesses is identified in the risk assessment, all persons working within the confined space must be attached to an appropriate lifeline that feeds back to a manned point outside the confined space. Additional Emergency Arrangements 30. When things go wrong people trying to help may unwittingly expose themselves to serious and immediate danger if they are not aware of the risks and the safe system for extracting casualties; therefore, effective additional arrangements for raising the alarm and carrying out rescue operations in an emergency should be developed, promulgated and implemented. These plans should be specific for each task or activity depending on the nature of the confined space, the risks identified and consequently the likely nature of an emergency rescue. The following factors should be considered in the emergency planning and effectively managed throughout the duration of the task or activity:""  ', '']"

Where the manufacturer or supplier has provided maintenance instructions for all or part of the system, these should form the basis of the maintenance programme. They should be supplemented as appropriate where they are not sufficiently comprehensive to cover the particular installation. In assessing whether the manufacturer’s or supplier’s instructions are sufficient, account should be taken of the complexity of the system, whether they cover the particular installation and reflect the on-site operating conditions. Only Competent Person(s) shall be authorised to maintain pressure systems. 15. Any pressure system (e.g. chemical oxygen generator, compressor) and associated equipment which may be used to supply breathable air, the air quality must be tested in compliance with the requirements in JSP 319.

Therefore, you should use MOD Form 1059 to record a road accident","['This passage is from JSP 765.pdf, page 16: ""2.42. The types of record which this provision relates to include any documentation completed during normal reporting procedures which confirms that the incident took place or medical treatment was administered, including records held electronically. These can include details from Incident Notification Cells, road traffic accident reports, hospital case notes, data obtained from the Defence Medical Information Capability Programme and GP notes. 2.43. For dates covered by the AFCS, Service personnel have an obligation to report incidents. All three Services have accident notification cells and reporting chains. If a report of the incident was not created at the time, the Service person could reasonably be asked if he or she has a credible reason for not filing a report. If no such reason is forthcoming, then it may be assumed the incident did not necessarily take place as claimed. 2.44. Where there is reliable evidence that an incident occurred in the circumstances described by the individual, this does not necessarily mean that any injury arising from that incident is deemed to be caused by service. The material fact to which the missing record relates will be decided in the individual’s favour, not necessarily the whole claim. For example, if the individual states that they broke their leg at an approved sports event and there is other evidence that the injury occurred but the Army file relating to the incident has been lost, DBS will presume that the individual did in fact break their leg at the event. If, for example, further evidence demonstrates that the individual was at the event as a spectator only and in a capacity unrelated to their own service, and was not participating in a sport activity, the individual will not receive compensation. Illness Caused by Service 2.45. Claims for illnesses including physical and mental health disorders are treated in exactly the same way as claims for injuries. The Services and all Defence organisations, including DMS and Defence Community Mental Health teams (DCMH), provide the supporting information to enable DBS to make evidence-based decisions.

PTW is also recommended for activities such as maintenance work and when two or more individuals or groups of people need to coordinate their activities to ensure that they do not compromise the safety of each other (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 30, paragraphs 4 and 5). Additionally, a PTW is required prior to carrying out certain activities such as excavation, hot work, work on electrical systems, work on fuel installations, work on boilers or other pressure systems, work at height, and work in any manhole or confined space (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 28, paragraph 16)","['This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 30.pdf, page 1: ""30 Permit to Work Contents Title Page Introduction 1 Roles and Responsibilities 2 Retention of Records 4 Related Documents 4 Annex A - Is a Permit To Work Required - Flow Chart A1 Introduction 1. This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance for the use of Permits to Work (PTW) to manage hazardous Defence activities with a high level of residual risk not already covered by Permit to Work procedure in JSP 375, Volume 3. 2. The MOD has a statutory duty to provide and maintain plant and systems of work, that are; so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risk to health. For high-risk activities, it is good practice to set-up a PTW system. The harmonisation of PTW systems between different locations can provide a familiar format and assist personnel moving between locations to understand the required controls and procedures to manage high risk activities. As systems become more complex, it is essential to coordinate them and understand inter-dependencies using the Safety and Environmental Case approach. It is therefore recommended that all new PTW systems or the revision / review of existing PTWs use the principles, guidance and templates contained within this leaflet. 3. A PTW is an effective means of controlling hazardous work activities and is a key element of the hierarchy or risk controls1. It shall be a formal written authority to a named competent person to closely control an activity or process, to which, following a risk assessment and the formulation of a Safe System of Work or a method statement, a high level of risk still exists. A PTW is the formalisation of a Safe System of Work but is not a guarantee of absolute safety. When Should a Permit to Work be Used? 4. A PTW should be used whenever it is intended to carry out any work which may adversely affect the safety of personnel, the environment or plant and equipment where assessment and the existing Safe System of Work do not fully mitigate the level of risk. A PTW is normal part of good-practice used as one of many risk control measures for activities such as maintenance work. 5. It is also advisable to use PTWs when two or more individuals or groups of people, perhaps from different trades or different contractors, need to co-ordinate their activities to ensure that they do not compromise the safety of each other; each 1 Management H&S at Work Regulations 1999, Schedule 1""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 34.pdf, page 19: ""Where your work is unlikely to have an impact on anybody else, the general site induction given at Step 1 may be sufficient.

If confined space working is unavoidable the manager should ensure a Safe System of Work is established and implemented. The following elements of a Safe System of Work should be adopted: a. the appointment of a Person in Charge (PIC); b. use the results of the risk assessment to help identify the necessary precautions and control measures to reduce the risk of injury; c. make sure that the Safe System of Work, including all the control measures identified, is developed and put into practice; d. ensure everyone involved is appropriately trained and instructed to make sure they know what to do and how to do it safely; and e. additional emergency procedures and recovery techniques.

Where the risk assessment requires the use of a PTW, this should be implemented in accordance with JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 30 or by adoption of the PTW system in JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6. A PTW allows a formal check to be undertaken to ensure all the elements of a Safe System of Work are in place before people are allowed to enter or work in the confined space. It is also a means of communication between management and those carrying out the task / activity. Suitability of Persons to do the Work 17. Persons conducting the work must be competent, this will include suitable and sufficient experience of the type of work to be carried out and a suitable and sufficient level of training. Where risk assessment highlights constraints as a result of the physical layout, the suitability of the individuals build and / or fitness may need to be considered. The PIC should consider other factors, e.g. concerning claustrophobia or fitness to wear breathing apparatus, and medical advice on an individual’s suitability may be needed. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 18. PPE should be used where risks cannot otherwise be adequately controlled and must be suitable and sufficient to provide the required levels of protection (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 15).

For the purposes of this chapter hot working means any activity or process that generates flame, heat or an incendiary spark and introduces (or presents) a foreseeable risk of fire or explosion through a source of ignition by means of tools or equipment either: a. intentionally arising from working methods (with or without the use of a naked flame) such as welding, flame-cutting, soldering, brazing; or b. the unintentional generation of heat or sparks, by the use of power hand tools e.g. grinding and the use of disc-cutters. 3. This chapter does not cover working in hot climates (information concerning working in hot climates is currently available in JSP 539). 4. Hot working has resulted in major historic fires and explosions which have caused a number of fatalities, serious injuries as well as property / asset losses. Where reasonably practicable the need for hot working should be eliminated by the use of other processes that do not involve the application or generation of heat or sparks. 5. Flammable liquids and vapours such as petrol, diesel, fuel oil, paints, solvents, glue, dusts etc are found in many places of work and under certain conditions (i.e. hot working) can explode violently (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 9 - DSEAR).

The RP must also make sure that all Defence personnel, visitors, and contractors are informed about the LMP and associated risk assessments. Additionally, commanders and managers responsible for a system that might present a legionella risk, and the personnel who might be exposed to that risk, should be familiar with the symptoms of Legionellosis and report any occurrence to their commander, manager, RP, or AP in accordance with Defence safety occurrence reporting procedures.

This chapter sets out the direction and guidance for Defence personnel involved in work activities and or who manage facilities where water is used or stored and where there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of an accumulation of legionella bacterium. Background 2. Legionnaires\' disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia which can affect anybody, but which principally affects those who are vulnerable because of age, illness, immunosuppression, smoking and so on. It is caused by the bacterium Legionella Pneumophila and related bacteria. Legionella bacteria can also cause less serious illnesses which are not fatal or permanently debilitating. The collective term used to cover the group of diseases caused by legionella bacteria is Legionellosis, the most serious of which is Legionnaires’ disease. 3. Legionellosis is normally contracted by inhaling legionella bacteria, either in tiny droplets of water or droplet nuclei (particles left after water has evaporated) contaminated with legionella, deep into the lungs. 4. Legionella bacteria are common and can be found naturally in environmental water sources such as rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Usually in low concentrations, the risk of inhalation of the bacteria from these sources is very low. Key health and safety legislation 5. Employers have a general duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (HSWA) to maintain safe working arrangements for their employees. There is a further duty on employers under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to carry out a risk assessment of the hazards to which their employees are exposed. 6. The principles of this legislation is extended worldwide by Secretary of State for Defence policy statement on health, safety and environmental protection. 7. The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2022 provides a framework of actions designed to control the risk from a range of hazardous substances, including legionella. 8. The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrence Regulations (RIDDOR) require reporting of exposure to legionella bacteria as an occupational disease (biological agent) to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). 9. There are also legal duties under The Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 which are applicable to laboratories and medical practitioners requiring them to notify local authorities when cases of Legionnaires’ disease are identified.""

Additionally, when excavating near buried services, hand digging should be used to locate and confirm the existence of services with minimal risk of causing damage and exposing hazards (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 33.pdf, page 6). Personnel should remain vigilant for buried or hidden services and undertake repeat checks using locating devices if a service is found (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 33.pdf, page 6).

Personnel should report any unsafe conditions including damage to a cable, pipe or pipe coating to the relevant authority; under no circumstances are unauthorised personnel to attempt repairs, work must cease, and the area made safe. 16. Where buried services are known or expected to exist, excavations should be carried out by hand-digging to locate and confirm the existence of services with the minimum of risk of causing damage and exposing hazards. This is particularly important if there are plastic pipes, or fibre-optics, which cannot be found by a locator. Hand digging should be done using spades and shovels in preference to picks, pins or forks. Existing standards set the minimum depth at which services should be buried. However, experience has shown that this is not always the case. Services are frequently buried at a lesser depth than that required by relevant standards; also, previous works on the site may have increased or reduced surface levels. 17. As work progresses, personnel should remain vigilant for buried or hidden services and undertake repeat checks using locating devices. If a service is found, checks should be made to ensure that it is the same service that was expected, as there may be more than one cable or pipe or ‘phantom’ services (this is where a second cable or pipe is located above the expected service and has not been previously located or recorded) which could compromise safety causing serious injuries or deaths.

36,How do I conduct an organisational safety assessment?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 8.pdf, page 1, conducting an organisational safety assessment involves identifying hazards and the risks that may arise from them, deciding whether reasonable steps are being taken to prevent harm, assessing the risks using a logical five-step process (identify hazards, decide who might be harmed and how, evaluate the risks and identify suitable and sufficient control measures, record and implement findings, and review the risk assessment and update as necessary), and making sure that suitable and sufficient risk assessments are carried out and recorded for all activities in line with the established policy statements. (Policy Statements 1-3) Therefore, to conduct an organisational safety assessment, one should follow these steps:

1. Identify all hazards that are reasonably foreseeable and associated with the activities under your command or supervision.
2. Decide who might be harmed and how by the activity being undertaken.
3. Evaluate the risks and identify suitable and sufficient control measures, which must be put in place and maintained.
4. Record and implement the findings of the risk assessment.
5. Review the risk assessment and update as necessary.

ACT Review performance / Act on lessons learned ● Review your performance. ● Learn from measurements and findings of investigations. ● Revisit the plan, policy documents and risk assessments to see if they need updating. ● Take action on lessons learned, including from audit and inspection reports. Safety culture 10. Leaders in Defence set the strategic direction for safety which influences how individuals within Defence behave in relation to safety and defines the culture of the organisation. 11. Culture can be best understood as ""the way we do things around here"" and safety culture can be defined as “the product of individual and group values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies and patterns of behaviour that determine the commitment, style and proficiency of the organisation\'s safety management.” A safety culture builds slowly, but behaviours are influenced quickly through strong leadership, messaging, expectations, and examples, this is known as the ‘tone from the top’. 12. Building a strong culture of safety is vital to prevent accidents, injuries and deaths. Defence organisations should show genuine care to those who deliver Defence activities, support open and honest reporting and set a culture where everyone feels able to speak up before and not just after things go wrong, rather than fearing blame. They should maintain policies and processes that develop and promote a positive safety culture throughout their organisation and area of responsibility, they should share and effectively communicate good practice and any safety lessons identified in order to promote and support continuous improvement. Clear aims and objectives 13. Defence organisations have flexibility to describe the elements of a strong safety culture using their own language. However, clear aims and objectives are important as they ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and all involved parties take the right steps in achieving an effective safety culture. The following steps should be taken by Defence organisations to achieve this: a. leaders should set clear expectations and communicate a ‘tone from the top’ based around their ‘duty of care’ for the health, safety and wellbeing of their people; b. leaders at all levels should be visible and proactive in promoting safety; c. their safety policies and procedures should be maintained, continually monitored and improved to mitigate human error.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 8.pdf, page 1: ""Safety risk assessment process 8. As part of managing H&S within Defence, the appropriate commander, manager, or accountable person must identify hazards and the risks that may arise from them and decide whether reasonable steps are being taken to prevent harm. The limits to the levels of risk that a commander, manager or accountable person may be authorised to hold, will vary depending upon the type and scale of the Defence activity for example, the exercise or operation. 9. Any identified risks must be assessed using the methodology set out in this chapter unless a chapter of JSP 375 that is specific to a particular hazard states otherwise. However, the principles of risk assessment remain the same. 10. Safety risk assessment (in this policy referred to as ‘risk assessment’) is a logical process which can be broken down into the following five steps (the five-step risk assessment process): Step 1 – Identify the hazards. Step 2 – Decide who might be harmed and how. Step 3 – Evaluate the risks and identify suitable and sufficient control measures. Step 4 – Record and implement findings. Step 5 – Review the risk assessment and update as necessary. 11. The appropriate commander, manager or accountable person is responsible for controlling risk in the workplace, so they must make sure that suitable and sufficient risk assessments are carried out and recorded.

37,How do I know if my workplace has asbestos and what precautions do I need to take if it does?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 26 and 15, if you suspect that your workplace contains asbestos, you should confirm its presence by checking the Asbestos Register or arranging for a sample of material to be analyzed. If asbestos is identified, appropriate control measures must be implemented to reduce exposure risk to a level that is ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). Commanders and managers must ensure that a person trained and competent in the management of asbestos conducts the risk assessment and identifies who may be at risk of exposure. Appropriate control measures, including the provision and use of appropriate PPE by personnel, must be implemented (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36, p. 20). Regular workplace inspections should also be carried out to check for signs of degradation or visible damage to asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36, p. 20).

When undertaking work which may result in exposure to asbestos fibres or dust, Defence personnel must wear the appropriate PPE and RPE as identified by the risk assessment. Defence personnel should examine PPE and RPE before use to make sure that it is not damaged, remains in good working order and an RPE fit test is carried out in accordance with Chapter 15 of JSP 375 Volume 1. Defence personnel should make sure that all protective clothing used for work involving asbestos is removed and placed in appropriately labelled and sealed bags or containers for disposal or cleaning by approved contractors. 20. APs should make sure that regular workplace inspections (see Chapter 4 of JSP 375, Volume 1) are carried out in accordance with the AMP. Inspections should include checking for signs of degradation or visible damage to ACMs. APs should make sure that reports received requiring remedial work or associated approvals are acted upon and monitored for completion within agreed timescales. 21. Annex B provides a guide to actions required on discovery of defects with or damage to known or presumed ACMs. Commanders, managers and APs (in conjunction with the appropriate Defence acquisition organisations and support and maintenance contractors) should consider the following factors in deciding on a course of action: a. the function that the ACM performs; b. the type and condition of the material; c. the frequency of disturbance or damage to the material; d. the amount of fibre that could potentially be released; e. the use of the infrastructure or equipment; f. the difficulty and cost of sealing or removal; and g. the cost of replacement, if required 22. If the ACM is loose, friable (crumbles easily), damaged or deteriorating, then it is reasonable to suspect that fibres are likely to be released; a further indicator is if there is asbestos dust or debris in the immediate area. Undamaged bonded materials such as insulating board and asbestos-cement, especially if coated, are much less likely to release dust. If there is the potential for the release of asbestos fibres but the material is in otherwise good condition and is functional, it may be appropriate to seal or encapsulate the material (in situ), label, record this action in the AR and manage the risk through the AMP, including periodic inspections. 23.

In Germany, where over 50% of families live in flats, possession of a pet may delay the allocation of SFA until a suitable 'pet' property becomes available. Additionally, occupants must keep pets under proper control and prevent nuisance, as failure to do so may result in permission to keep the pet being revoked (JSP 464 Vol 1 Part 1, page 91). In military camps specifically, approval for assistance animals is granted where their presence poses no significant risk to health or safety, and suitable facilities and arrangements for disposal of animal waste must be put in place before approval is granted (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 38, page 2).

Keeping pets in SFA. It is recognised that many occupants like to keep pets for comfort and protection. However, the wishes of the occupants to keep pets have to be balanced against the sensitivities of other occupants living nearby, and the availability of suitable facilities within the SFA for the pet. In BF(G), families should be aware that ‘Dangerous Dog’ legislation is applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany. German legislation contains special requirements to be met covering both dogs and owner before permission is given for the animal to remain in the country. For other countries occupants should enquire about local laws prior to moving. In order to keep a pet in SFA, the occupant is required to seek written permission (Annex B to MOD F1132 – SFA application form) from the IPHD/GSO/SSO overseas at each duty station before acquiring the pet/bringing the pet into the SFA. The occupant is required to seek written permission from the IPHD/GSO/SSO overseas for each pet. The IPHD/GSO/SSO overseas will normally permit small domestic pets except where: a. The SFA is considered by the IPHD/GSO/SSO overseas to be unsuitable for the type of domestic pet (e.g. a dog requires exercise outside and the flat/house has no private garden). Additionally, in hired properties, most Landlords refuse permission to keep a pet in their residences. This applies particularly in Germany where over 50% of families live in flats. In this context, families need to be aware that the possession of a pet may delay the allocation of SFA until a suitable ‘pet’ property becomes available. b. The animal is not a generally recognised type of domestic pet. Recognised pets are considered to be dogs, cats, rabbits, caged birds or other small caged animals. c. The pet has according to the IPHD/ (GSO/SSO overseas) records, caused a nuisance in the past at previous SFA. d. The occupant already has other pets. The IPHD/GSO/SSO overseas will consider applications to keep further pets on a case by case basis. 0621. Control of pets. Occupants must make certain undertakings including keeping pets under proper control and preventing nuisance. a. Failure to keep to these undertakings may mean that permission to keep a pet will be revoked by the IPHD/ (GSO/SSO overseas). Whilst every effort will be made to allocate suitable SFA to pet owners it cannot be guaranteed. In Germany, German legislation provides strict control measures to owners of pets and in particular to dogs. Failure to keep within the law may not only result in criminal proceedings by Local Authorities but is also likely to lead to permission to keep a pet being revoked.

Where there is a reason for such groups to exist, CO / HoE is advised to have a written agreement with the group confirming that a condition of their continued presence is that health and safety and environmental legislation is applied to their operations. Site Control and Contractors 13. MOD has derogations and exemptions from parts of the legislation but contractors working for MOD do not. In order to determine whether legislation applies and how it is applied, it is often necessary to determine which organisation has control of a site or work activity.

When an activity exceeds any of the figures in the work/rest tables (work rate, WBGT forecast or duration) the responsible commander must re-assess the risk and consider stopping or pausing the activity, applying additional control measures and, if required, elevating the risk through their chain of command for approval. • The QT34 is the only monitor approved by Defence for measuring WBGT outdoors and indoors.  • The WBGT is a combined measure of the dry-bulb temperature (the air temperature), wet-bulb temperature (the temperature the air can be cooled to through wind speed and the effect of evaporation) and globe temperature (a temperature that takes account of the effect of radiation such as sunlight). It is measured in degrees Celsius.  • You can use the QT34 monitor to check the difference between the dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature.

2. Dry affected feet and hands, replace wet socks or gloves as needed, and provide supplementary whole-body insulation.
3. Encourage intake of fluids to help peripheral perfusion where dehydration is a contributing factor.

5. Use paracetamol and/or ibuprofen for pain control if necessary.
6. Alert the Chain of Command that there has been a cold injury during the activity, as others may also be at risk.
7. Evacuate the patient to safety immediately and do not allow them to return to the cold environment even if they appear to have recovered.
8. Arrange a routine appointment with a medical officer, preferably one with experience in managing NFCI. If the patient has significant skin changes, cannot walk, or their pain is not controlled by paracetamol and/or ibuprofen alone, an urgent appointment is required.

Exposure should start with short periods spent in relatively mild conditions, building up to longer periods in more severe conditions. The person should be exposed to the full range of duties required of their career employment group (CEG). For example, those who deploy forward should spend at least three consecutive nights in UK winter conditions or equivalent. MOD Form 5010 should be used to record risk assessments, but alternatives specified by a Military Command’s or Defence organisation’s Safety and Environmental Management Systems (SEMS) may be used.

Hypothermia can develop slowly e.g. during a cold UK Exercise, or rapidly, e.g. during immersion or extreme cold. Hypothermia is also a risk to casualties with moderate to severe injuries in any climate. Cold injury includes whole-body cooling, i.e. hypothermia, and cooling of the extremities such as hands and feet, i.e. freezing cold injury (FCI) or non-freezing cold injury (NFCI). NFCI is the most common of these and mostly occurs in the UK during training Exercises. Non-Freezing Cold Injury (NFCI) is caused by gradual, prolonged cooling of the hands or feet. It does not have to be freezing to get an NFCI; most cases occur in the UK during training.  Freezing Cold Injury (FCI) happens in sub-zero temperatures and includes frost nip and frost bite. Parts of the body most prone to freezing are the extremities and exposed areas, e.g. nose, ears, fingers and toes.

Duty times should consider how quickly personnel are becoming cold. ▪  If possible, avoid static training in locations that are particularly damp or wet. ▪  In fighting positions, sentry points and observations points reduce risk of cold injury by placing pads, sleeping bags, tree branches, leaves etc inside these positions to allow occupants to insulate themselves from the ground or snow. Immersion Cold water presents its own additional risks and cooling is much more rapid in water than air. ▪  Avoid immersion in cold water unless it is an approved requirement and absolutely necessary for example; ▪  If it must go ahead plan for wet-dry drills and re-  warming exercise immediately afterwards. ▪  Personnel working in cold water should be watched closely while they enter the water, as sudden plunging into cold water can disrupt breathing and heart rhythm (cold shock). • Recognise that some personnel will cool faster than others, for example those who are lean.

Good leadership, proper training and best practice can prevent or reduce the severity of cold injury. This guide sets out five policy statements, as established by Defence, that must be met. It also provides guidance on how to assess and manage the risk of cold injury as part of Defence’s standard risk-assessment process. Prevention of cold injuries is the responsibility of commanders at all levels as well as individuals.  The application of the cold injury prevention policy must be assured (that is, its use must be guaranteed). As part of their overall assurance activity, commanders or managers must make sure that the policy is followed and put into practice effectively. Assurance must be carried out as set out in JSP 815.  Scope  This guide applies to all those employed by Defence (military or civilian) as well as those working on behalf of Defence (for example, contractors). It applies to all Defence activities carried out in any location (UK or overseas).  How body cooling occurs  As well as natural heat loss, body heat can be lost by touching something cold (for example, by standing or lying on cold ground), by being in wind or water (convection), and through evaporation (for example, through sweat or rain). Humans cool two to five times more quickly in cold water compared to in air of the same temperature.  Preventing cooling  Even in extremely low temperatures, peripheral (skin level) and core (internal) temperature, along with performance levels, can be safely maintained if the right equipment is used and the right behaviours are demonstrated. Conversely, cold injury may occur in only moderately cold environments when skills are poor, there is little or no opportunity to use the correct equipment, or it is not reasonably possible to limit exposure to the cold. So adopting appropriate strategies for maintaining body temperature in cold environments is crucial.  General Gwyn Jenkins CB OBE ADC Vice Chief Defence Staff  “Cold injuries are some of the most common medical conditions affecting members of the Armed Forces. They are frequently debilitating and can be potentially life threatening and range from the mild discomfort caused by chilblains to potentially life threatening hypothermia. But common to all is their impact on Defence capability and their preventable nature; leaders, at all levels, are accountable for both.  Around the globe we often find ourselves living and operating in the harshest environments. But cold injuries can also be sustained in temperate environments too. As leaders, at all levels, our first duty is always Duty of Care and the welfare of our personnel and so we must ensure that both we and those serving under us understand how to prevent, recognise and respond to cold injury.""

This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance on health and safety issues related to the disposal, closure or transfer of control of Defence establishments. 2. Achieving the effective transfer of control, closure or disposal of Defence estate or establishment is a complicated process, which requires careful planning and the provision of significant resources. The activities, facilities, plant, equipment and the associated risks may differ considerably between establishments. Resources to manage them through any transitional period needs to be tailored to the constantly changing workplace environment and risk profile. The transfer of control can be between TLBs and agencies or between the MOD and a business partner as part of a Private Finance Initiative, Public & Private Partnership (PFI / PPP), etc. 3. The closure and subsequent disposal of Defence estate or an establishment should be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) Functional Standard, Design Maintenance Guide 12 (DMG 12) - Site Closure Guide - which may also be used in part as further guidance for the handover of an establishment between TLBs / agencies. This chapter serves to supplement DMG 12 in clarifying responsibilities within Defence for the discharge of health and safety duties. Roles and Responsibilities Top Level Budget Holder (TLB) 4. Preparing to vacate an establishment involves three main interrelated tasks which the occupying TLB responsible should address in co-ordination with the infrastructure owners and other stakeholders as necessary.

49,What is the safe system of work and how can I implement it?,"A Safe System of Work (SSW) is a method of work that puts in place control measures arising from a risk assessment to eliminate identified hazards and complete the work with minimum risk. To implement a SSW, you should follow these steps as outlined in JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 8.pdf:

1. Conduct a specific risk assessment for the proposed use of the space and any control measures put in place.
2. Establish safe practices, which are usually written procedures detailing how to perform an activity with minimum risk to personnel, equipment, materials, and the environment. These written methods should be risk assessed to make sure the risk of harm or damage remains ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) and tolerable.
3. Implement a safe system of training (SST) for personnel who are not yet competent, ensuring they receive appropriate information, instruction, and supervision.
4. Ensure everyone involved is appropriately trained and instructed to make sure they know what to do and how to do it safely.
5. Establish additional emergency procedures and recovery techniques as necessary.

Additionally, if confined space working is unavoidable, you should establish a Safe System of Work for that specific situation by appointing a Person in Charge (PIC), identifying necessary precautions and control measures, developing and implementing the system, training everyone involved, and ensuring emergency procedures are in place (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 28).

If required by a risk assessment, you may also need to implement a Permit-to-Work (PTW) system to ensure all elements of a Safe System of Work are in place before people are allowed to enter or work in the confined space (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 28 and JSP 375 Vol 3 Ch 6)","['This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 28.pdf, page 2: ""Safe Systems of Work 15.

Where the risk assessment requires the use of a PTW, this should be implemented in accordance with JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 30 or by adoption of the PTW system in JSP 375, Volume 3, Chapter 6. A PTW allows a formal check to be undertaken to ensure all the elements of a Safe System of Work are in place before people are allowed to enter or work in the confined space.

Persons conducting the work must be competent, this will include suitable and sufficient experience of the type of work to be carried out and a suitable and sufficient level of training. Where risk assessment highlights constraints as a result of the physical layout, the suitability of the individuals build and / or fitness may need to be considered. The PIC should consider other factors, e.g. concerning claustrophobia or fitness to wear breathing apparatus, and medical advice on an individual’s suitability may be needed. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 18. PPE should be used where risks cannot otherwise be adequately controlled and must be suitable and sufficient to provide the required levels of protection (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 15). When working in confined spaces, the selection of suitable PPE needs to take into consideration the environment in which it is to be worn to ensure that it does not introduce new risks, e.g. bulky clothing used to protect workers from extremes of temperature may restrict movement and limit effective rescue.""

This chapter sets out the procedures and guidance for the use of Permits to Work (PTW) to manage hazardous Defence activities with a high level of residual risk not already covered by Permit to Work procedure in JSP 375, Volume 3. 2. The MOD has a statutory duty to provide and maintain plant and systems of work, that are; so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risk to health. For high-risk activities, it is good practice to set-up a PTW system. The harmonisation of PTW systems between different locations can provide a familiar format and assist personnel moving between locations to understand the required controls and procedures to manage high risk activities. As systems become more complex, it is essential to coordinate them and understand inter-dependencies using the Safety and Environmental Case approach. It is therefore recommended that all new PTW systems or the revision / review of existing PTWs use the principles, guidance and templates contained within this leaflet. 3. A PTW is an effective means of controlling hazardous work activities and is a key element of the hierarchy or risk controls1. It shall be a formal written authority to a named competent person to closely control an activity or process, to which, following a risk assessment and the formulation of a Safe System of Work or a method statement, a high level of risk still exists. A PTW is the formalisation of a Safe System of Work but is not a guarantee of absolute safety. When Should a Permit to Work be Used? 4. A PTW should be used whenever it is intended to carry out any work which may adversely affect the safety of personnel, the environment or plant and equipment where assessment and the existing Safe System of Work do not fully mitigate the level of risk. A PTW is normal part of good-practice used as one of many risk control measures for activities such as maintenance work. 5. It is also advisable to use PTWs when two or more individuals or groups of people, perhaps from different trades or different contractors, need to co-ordinate their activities to ensure that they do not compromise the safety of each other; each 1 Management H&S at Work Regulations 1999, Schedule 1""  ', '']"
50,How do I record a risk assessment for dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 9 (page 9), a DSEAR risk assessment must be completed in accordance with JSP 375 Volume 1, Chapter 8, and the results of the assessment should include the identification, consideration, and careful examination of various factors such as the hazardous properties of the substance, information on safety provided by the supplier, the amount of the substance involved, work processes, procedures, and substances used, and their possible interactions. The risk assessments must be documented and records kept (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 9, page 10). For COSHH assessments, any additional emergency procedures specific to the risk assessment must be clearly documented and recorded on the COSHH assessment form (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 11). The use of templates for COSHH assessments and master registers is optional but preferred (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 6).

Therefore, to record a risk assessment for dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres, you should follow the guidelines outlined in JSP 375 Volume 1, Chapter 8 for DSEAR assessments and JSP 375 Volume 1, Chapter 11 for COSHH assessments. Document and record all findings, including any necessary control measures, on the appropriate assessment form or register.

The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) require the MOD to assess the risk of harm to personnel from fires or explosions involving dangerous substances in the workplace. These risks must be eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable. The aim is to both prevent harm to Defence personnel, contractors, visitors and members of the public who may be put at risk, and to minimise collateral damage. 2. The Regulations complement the requirement to manage risks under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations and transpose two European Directives (the Chemical Agents Directive (98 / 24 / EC) and the Explosive Atmospheres Directive (99 / 92 / EC)) into UK legislation. They also replace older regulations dealing with flammable substances safety. 3. DSEAR deals with the immediate danger to life or health from fires or explosions resulting from the ignition of dangerous substances and should not be confused with COSHH which deals with the chronic and acute health effects of exposure to substances hazardous to health. Processes and the storage involving dangerous substances that require a DSEAR assessment will also require COSHH assessments. 4. The manufacture, handling, use, storage and transport of explosives is not covered in this chapter, these requirements are covered in specific Joint Service Publications (JSPs) and Defence Regulations (DSA02).""

Any additional emergency procedures specific to the risk assessment must be clearly documented and recorded on the COSHH assessment form; these are in addition to the existing emergency arrangements. Emergency Services information needs to be building location specific and available out of normal working hours. These may include notification to the local fire service of substances held at the establishment / unit / platform, to aid them in awareness of hazards should they need to attend.  Part 2: Guidance This part provides the guidance and best practice that should be followed using the Plan, Do, Check, Act approach and will help you to keep to this policy. PLAN - identify problems and opportunities 1. Like any health and safety assessment, a COSHH assessment should begin with a thorough walk-around observation of all areas and processes in the workplace, including waste storage and disposal systems (the COSHH Assessment Process Flowchart is at Annex A of this chapter). 2. The requirement following substances directly identified, is to design and operate processes and activities to minimise emission, release and spread of substances hazardous to health, by considering the following: a. consider ways to achieve and maintain control of exposures where prevention is not deemed practicable (decisions should be recorded), e.g. ventilation systems, containment, substituting materials; b. disposal and other similar issues following an incident have been considered and documented; c. this information may also inform the final equipment disposal requirements allowing the risk from such activities to be considered and planned for early on the equipment life cycle; d. identify all potentially exposed groups (including cleaners and maintenance); e. list significant sources of exposure and how people could be exposed; f. reduce number of sources; g. reduce emission rate; h. segregation of large sources; i. enclosure of sources; j. Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV); k. lessons learned, and resultant amended work processes should controls prove inadequate; or l. organise the work to minimise the number of people exposed and the duration, frequency, and level of exposure. 3. Consider all relevant routes of exposure - inhalation, skin absorption and ingestion - when developing control measures, consider the following: a. how does contaminant get into the air? b. how does contaminant get onto skin, eyes, and other soft tissue?""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11.pdf, page 6: ""d. include a register to track items in circulation and assist in stock control and waste management; e. consider storage of items and the control of hazardous substances. A storage plan may be created, and colour coded to assist in segregation of high-risk items, cages and locked cabinets must be implemented where required; and f. consider the risk of exposure as recognised in lessons identified from accidents, incidents, and emergencies data. 17. Processes that use or produce hazardous substances must be risk assessed: a. in the design and development process to design out or minimise their use or production; b. when substances (e.g. dust or vapours) result from a process or activity or which arise as a result of an accident or emergency; c. when substances arise as wastes or residues from processes or activities, including scrap material; and d. when substances arise as a result of interaction with another process or activity in the vicinity. 18. A template for a COSHH assessment (MOD Form 5011) and for a COSHH master register (MOD Form 5011a) are available on the Defence Intranet. The use of these templates is optional but should be regarded as the preferred and the minimum information required. Policy Statement 2 The commander or line manager, or accountable person (AP) must make sure that the risks associated with exposure to any substance hazardous to health are evaluated and identify suitable and sufficient control measures, which must be implemented and maintained. 19. Competent persons are required throughout the organisation and must be involved at all stages of managing risk in a process or activity including evaluation and identification of suitable and sufficient control measures. 20. Record the significant findings. The assessor (if not the commander or line manager) should bring the findings of the assessment (taking into account any variation due to local conditions, changes in use and personnel issues and, if appropriate, explain the risks) and the required control measures to manage those risks to the attention of the commander or line manager.

The Director of Defence Safety (DS) is responsible for developing and maintaining effective Safety policies and guidance on behalf of the SofS for Defence. These policies are published in Joint Service Publications (JSPs) or Defence Instructions and Notices (DINs). JSP 815 (this JSP) is the overarching Defence Safety Management System (SMS) and JSP 375 (Management of Health and Safety in Defence) is the JSP that covers the basic arrangements for complying with safety law. Each chapter covers a separate hazard or work environment in which health and safety measures are needed to protect employees. 9. Defence safety policy provides the direction that must be followed to help Defence organisations comply with (keep to) safety law, primarily the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) and its underpinning statutory regulations. It also provides guidance on the processes to be applied in discharging their duties of care required by law and good practice that should be followed to help Defence organisations to apply the policy. 10. Defence organisations are to make sure that safety policy is being followed and put into practice effectively as part of their overall assurance activity. Defence organisations are to notify the Director DS if they are permanently unable to comply with parts of any safety policy. In such circumstances, the head of the relevant Defence organisation is to send a detailed request to apply an ‘alternative acceptable means of compliance’ for specific parts of the policy, giving the reasons for the request, to Director DS. 11. The Director DS leads on the policy review process to make sure Defence safety policy remains in line with the relevant UK safety legislation. The Defence organisations provide the Director DS with resources and expertise for developing Defence safety policy as part of the stakeholder consultation process. Views and input from SMEs and personnel are essential to make sure that the Defence organisation’s requirements are considered in new and emerging safety legislation or Defence policy and the potential impact that this may have on the capabilities of the organisation, its personnel and those working on behalf of the organisation, for example, contractors. 12. Defence organisations may own and maintain specific safety policy that is contained in their own publications; however, they are responsible for making sure that any specific safety policy is written in line with the overarching Defence Safety Management System (SMS) and does not conflict with any Defence safety policy and regulations. 13. Defence organisations should: a. proactively identify and incorporate good practice from external sources, supply chain, and other relevant bodies when developing new safety policy, guidance and processes; b. monitor existing policy, guidance and processes to make sure they are operating effectively; c""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 40: ""Annex A - Legislation supporting JSP 317 The list below outlines the main pieces of Statutory Legislation that support the safe storage and handling of industrial gases and cryogenic liquids. 1.

52,How do I produce the safety case for a new piece of equipment?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7.pdf, page 6, the production of a safety case for a new piece of equipment should start as early in the acquisition lifecycle as possible and be an integrated part of the equipment design (paragraphs 16 and 17). The safety case should provide justification that the equipment is safe to use and aid in its design and acquisition programme planning (paragraph 16). Planning the safety argument for the equipment should inform the safety requirements and the type of activities necessary to generate evidence to support the safety case (paragraph 17). Safety cases should be forward-looking, considering activities beyond normal operation and training, as well as manufacturing, testing, commissioning, transporting, storing, maintaining, and disposing of the equipment safely (paragraph 18). Stakeholder input is required for validating assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other DLODs and ensuring that activities can be carried out safely and easily (paragraph 19). Safety cases should be updated to match the configuration of the equipment and when there is a material change to the understanding, risk profile, design, or operation of the equipment (paragraph 18).

Therefore, to produce a safety case for a new piece of equipment, you should:

1. Start as early as possible in the acquisition lifecycle.
2. Integrate it into the equipment design.
3. Plan the safety argument that will be made when the system is delivered and used in service.
4. Consider activities beyond normal operation and training.
5. Involve stakeholders for validation and input.
6. Update the safety case as necessary to match changes in the equipment's configuration, understanding, risk profile, design, or operation.
7. Ensure that all relevant safety issues have been considered by the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) or User.
8. Capture all safety-related risks associated with the equipment and evidence how these risks will be managed to as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level.
9. Regularly review, endorse, and certify the safety case throughout the lifecycle of the acquisition lifecycle of the system.
10. Concurrently assure the safety case under the 3LOD Model by internal regulators and external assurers if required.

Construction of the safety case for an equipment should start as early in the acquisition lifecycle as possible and should be an integrated part of the equipment design, rather than a supplementary activity. As well as providing a justification that the equipment is (or will be) safe to use, the safety case should be an aid to its design and the planning of the acquisition programme. Planning in advance the safety argument that the SRO hopes to be able to make when a system is delivered and used in service should inform the safety requirements for the equipment, and the type of activities that will be necessary in the acquisition programme and during operation to generate the evidence to support the safety case. This information should in turn support decisions such as the choice of supplier and whether to use a bespoke, off-the-shelf or customised design. 17. Safety cases for equipment should be forward-looking and take into account activities beyond normal operation and training. They must also consider how equipment can be manufactured, tested, commissioned, transported, stored, maintained and disposed of safely. Stakeholder input will be required to validate assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other DLODs. Input from human factors specialists is also likely to be required to ensure these activities can be carried out safely and easily. Risk controls that cannot be put into practice easily are unlikely to be effective. 18. Safety cases should be updated to match the configuration of the equipment and when there is a ‘material change’ to the understanding, risk profile, design or operation of the equipment. Safety performance monitoring of the equipment should be maintained throughout the in-service phase for sustaining the safe performance of that equipment, any safety related issues identified must be acted upon. They should also be recorded in the safety case to demonstrate in an auditable way that the safety of the equipment is being achieved. 19. When equipment has been in service for a long time, it is particularly important to check that the assumptions made by the safety case are still valid and have not been undermined by factors such deterioration in the material state of aging equipment, obsolescence of the parts or services necessary to support them, or demographic changes in the user community.

Where a risk assessment is not sufficient to demonstrate that the risks to the equipment have been adequately identified, communicated and/or controlled, then a safety case must be developed. A safety case is used to provide compelling evidence that equipment is safe for a given application in a given operating environment. A safety case must capture all the safety related risks associated with that equipment and evidence how these risks will be managed to as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level. 15. The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) or the User, is responsible for making sure that a safety case has been produced and that all relevant safety issues have been considered. Safety cases are covered in JSP 815 Part 2 (Elements 4 and 7) and in more detail in JSP 376 - Defence Acquisition Safety Policy. Policy Statement 3 All changes to, or deviations from, requirements in a regulation, policy or training provided by or on behalf of Defence must be proportionately; evaluated, risk assessed, approved, implemented and documented. 16. This policy is applicable to all changes to, or deviations from, requirements in a regulation, policy or to training provided by or on behalf of Defence. The safety implications of such changes must be considered by the change owner by following a systematic process to make sure that the change is evaluated, risk assessed, approved, implemented and documented. 17. Where changes or amendments are made to Defence regulations, policy or other controlled documents then a record of those amendments and the reasons for them must be maintained by the change owner. 18. Where deviations from requirements are necessary or Defence organisations are unable to comply with all or parts of JSP 375 Defence safety policy, they must notify the Director of Defence Safety with the specific details of why they are permanently unable to comply with all or parts of that safety policy. 19.

The Defence organisation creates and maintains safety cases for the acquisition lifecycle for all activities and equipment requiring them. Safety cases are either owned by the Senior Responsible Person (SRO) or the User and independently assured. Industrial partners give relevant support. Stakeholder engagement should be undertaken for both safe to operate and operate safely aspects. 22. A safety case is to be: a. proportionate to the risks which the system poses and are readily accessible to the workforce; b. understood by the operators and training given to them to provide that knowledge where appropriate; c. regularly reviewed, endorsed by the SRO or User; d. certified throughout the lifecycle of the acquisition lifecycle of the system; and e. concurrently assured under the 3LOD Model (see Element 12) by internal regulators (DSA) and external assurers (Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA)) if required by further Defence policy (for example JSP 655 – Defence Investment Approvals) or wider Government policy. 23. Each potential acquisition strategy may have a different safety philosophy and safety case. Different approaches may be appropriate depending on whether capability is being acquired as a standalone product, an integrated system or platform, or as a managed service. Whatever approach is taken, the safety case for the capability should cover the whole service and not just the equipment design. Methods of risk management 24. Defence organisations should identify and manage their safety risks in a consistent, rigorous and technically robust way. There are various approaches for identifying and managing risks, however the approach recommended by the Director DS for safety risks is the bow-tie method. 25. The bow-tie method is a visual tool that diagrammatically represents the different elements of a safety risk so that it can be viewed in a risk picture which is shaped like a bow-tie as shown in Figure 2. Further details on the bow-tie and other methods of risk identification and management can be found in JSP 892 (Risk Management). Figure 2 – Bow-tie illustration""  ', '']"
53,What do I have to do after taking a prisoner of war?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 383.pdf, if you take a prisoner of war, you must immediately institute an official inquiry into any death or serious injury caused by you or suspected to have been caused by you (JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, page 261, paragraphs 8.173.1 and 8.174). You must notify the protecting power and take statements from witnesses, especially prisoners of war, and forward a report including these statements to the protecting power (JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, page 261, paragraphs 8.173.1 and 8.174). The detaining power is responsible for ensuring that any person or persons found to be responsible for the death or injury are duly prosecuted (JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, page 261, paragraph 8.173.1).

Therefore, after taking a prisoner of war, you must follow the procedures outlined in JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, pages 261-262, paragraphs 8.173.1 and 8.174, to ensure that any death or serious injury is properly investigated and those responsible are held accountable.

Statements must be taken from all witnesses,  especially those who are prisoners of war, and a report including such state-  ments forwarded to the protecting power. The detaining power is to ensure  that any person or persons found to be responsible for the death or injury  are duly prosecuted.452  Procedure on Termination of Captivity  Notification  Prisoners of war who are to be moved must be listed before departure and  both the information bureau and the prisoners of war themselves officially  notified in advance so that they can pack their baggage and inform their  next of kin.453  Personal property  Impounded articles of value454 and any currency which has not been con-  verted into that of the detaining power must be returned to the prisoners of  war concerned and any items not returned must be sent to the information  bureau.455 Prisoners of war must be allowed to take with them their per-  sonal property and any correspondence and parcels that have arrived for  them.

In the case of the death of a prisoner of war in United Kingdom hands, the  procedure laid down in Prisoners of War Handling (JWP 1–10), 3F, 84 is to be  followed.  Burial or cremation  No prisoner of war may be buried or cremated without a prior medical  examination to confirm that life is extinct, to enable a report on the death to  be made, and, if necessary, to establish identity.447 If a prisoner of war was  seriously wounded when captured, his identity may not have been estab-  lished before death. It follows that the report should, in such cases, contain,  for example, a description and measurement of the body, details of teeth  and fingerprints, and a photograph. The detaining power must ensure hon-  ourable burial,448 if possible in accordance with the rites of the deceased’s  religion. Wherever possible, dead prisoners of war belonging to the same  state are to be buried in the same place and in individual graves unless cir-  cumstances make the use of collective graves unavoidable. A prisoner of  war may not be cremated unless that accords with his religion, personal  wishes, or the imperative demands of hygiene. In every such case, the fact  of and the reason for cremation must be noted on the death certificate.449  Maintenance of graves and disposal of ashes  In order to ensure that graves may always be readily traced, particulars of  burials and of graves are to be recorded by a graves registration service to  be established by the detaining power.450 List of graves and particulars of  prisoners of war interred in cemeteries and elsewhere are to be transmitted  to the state with which the prisoners served. The state on whose territory  graves are situated (if a party to the Convention) is responsible for the  maintenance of those graves. In addition, it should keep records of bodies  that are moved to other graves.

PAROLE OF PRISONERS OF WAR  Release on Parole  An alternative to internment in a prisoner of war camp is release on  parole.310 This may be either permanent or temporary provided that it is  permissible under the law of the power on which the prisoner of war  depends.311 On the outbreak of hostilities, each state involved must notify  the enemy of its laws and regulations relating to parole.  Effect of Parole  A prisoner of war may be partially or wholly released on parole, that is, in  return for an undertaking not to escape and rejoin his own armed forces.312  It is preferable for the precise terms of the parole to be in writing, signed by  the prisoner of war, to avoid doubt about its conditions. Aduplicate should  be sent to the state on which the prisoner of war depends. Prisoners of war  who are paroled are bound on their personal honour to observe scrupu-  lously the conditions of parole. The state on which they depend is bound  not to require or accept any service from them that would be incompatible  with those conditions.

All other aircraft were deemed private aircraft.14  The term ‘military aircraft’ is not defined in any treaty but the Air  Navigation Order, the Chicago Convention, and the custom and practice of  international law taken together give some guidelines. The Air Navigation  Order states that ‘military aircraft’ means the naval, military, or air force  aircraft of any country and:  a. ‘any aircraft being constructed for the naval, military or air force of any  country under a contract entered into by the Secretary of State’; and  b. ‘any aircraft in respect of which there is in force a certificate issued by the  Secretary of State that the aircraft is to be treated for the purpose of this  Order as a military aircraft’.15  Generally, the status of the aircraft will be determined by its uses.  Military aircraft can include, for example, transport, reconnaissance, and  meteorological aircraft of the armed forces of a particular state whether or  not they are used in a direct combatant role. These aircraft must bear exter-  nal markings indicating clearly their nationality and military character.16 In  most air forces, the same marking indicates both nationality and military  character, for example, the Royal Air Force roundel. Additional markings  to indicate an international grouping such as NATO are permissible but  modifications of this nature adopted by any state must be promptly noti-  fied to all other states.17 The captain and crew of military aircraft must wear  clearly recognizable uniform with badges of rank at all times, as should  any military passengers.18 For this purpose, regulation flying clothing is  Air Operations  311  12.10  12.10.1  12.10.2  12.10.3  12.10.4  13 SRM 13(j). The UK Air Navigation Order, see para 12.4, refers to foreign military aircraft  as ‘the naval, military or air force aircraft of any country’. The elements in this definition are  useful in identifying such aircraft. Military aircraft in the UK would comply with these  requirements.

55,Can an occupying force make and enforce laws in an occupied territory?,"Yes, according to the provided reference text, an occupying force can make and enforce laws in an occupied territory within certain limits. The occupying power may amend existing law or promulgate new law if necessary for maintaining order, ensuring the welfare of the population, or fulfilling international obligations (JSP 383.pdf, page 337, paragraphs 11.23-11.25). However, these laws must not conflict with the occupying power's obligations under international law, such as the Geneva Conventions (HR, Art 43). The local courts retain jurisdiction to deal with cases that are not of a military nature or affecting the safety of the occupying forces, but they must enforce the proper laws and orders of the occupying power (JSP 383.pdf, page 120, paragraphs 11.25.1-11.27). The occupying power may also establish its own military courts to try offenses created by its legislation (GC IV, Art 66; JSP 383.pdf, page 334, paragraphs 11.59 and 11.60). These courts must apply provisions of law applicable at the time of the commission of the offense and accord with general principles of law and human rights guarantees in the occupying power's law (JSP 383.pdf, page 334, paragraph 11.59.1)","['This passage is from JSP 383.pdf, page 337: ""forces may be dealt with according to security laws previously introduced  by the occupying power.49 Internment may also be ordered in the interests  of the security of the occupying power.50  The Law  The law in force  There is an obligation during the occupation to respect the laws in force in  the occupied territory unless absolutely prevented.51 An occupying power  11.23  11.24  11.25  Occupied Territory  283  11.22  45 GC IV, Art 54.

The occupying power is not obliged to use the full powers available  under the laws in force in occupied territory. It may suspend any of those laws  that affect its own security, for example, those concerning conscription, elec-  toral enfranchisement, rights of public assembly, the bearing of arms, and the freedom of the press. The right of the inhabitants to take legal action in the  local courts must not be affected.52 The occupying power may amend the  existing law of the occupied territory or promulgate new law if this is necessi-  tated by the exigencies of armed conflict, the maintenance of order, or the wel-  fare of the population.53The domestic law of the occupying power (apart from  that affecting its own armed forces) does not extend to occupied territory.  Since the occupying power has a duty to look after the welfare of the  inhabitants, regulations, for example, fixing prices and securing the equi-  table distribution of food and other commodities, are permissible. The  occupying power should make no more changes to the law than are  absolutely necessary, particularly where the occupied territory already has an adequate legal system.  Jurisdiction  The courts of occupied territory retain jurisdiction to deal with any of the  inhabitants’ cases that are neither of a military nature, nor affect the safety  of the occupying forces. Jurisdiction in the latter two cases is a matter for the  authorities of the occupying power. Members of the occupying forces and  their civilian component are normally not subject to the jurisdiction of the  local courts but remain under that of their own military authorities.54  Local courts  The local courts may be suspended only if necessitated by the judges’ or  magistrates’ refusal to act or on account of the behaviour of the inhabitants.  In those circumstances, the occupying power must establish and duly pub-  licize its own courts.

In theory, both the local courts and those of the occupying power  would have jurisdiction to try members of the occupying forces for grave breaches. In practice,  jurisdiction in those cases would usually be exercised by the occupying power.  Original Publication of measures  The suspension, modification, or replacement of law or courts must be  published to the population of the occupied territory in their own language.  Criminal law  The special rules of the Convention dealing with the administration of  criminal law in occupied territory are dealt with in paragraphs 11.56 to 11.74.  The Economy  Occupation costs  The economy of an occupied country can only be required to bear the  expenses of the occupation and these should not be greater than the economy  of the country can reasonably be expected to bear.55  Taxation  If the occupying power collects taxes, duties, and tolls which were  payable in the occupied state, it is bound to apply them towards the cost  of administering that territory.56 As far as possible, it must do so in  accordance with the existing tax laws but any balance may be applied  towards the maintenance of the occupying forces. However, local rates  may only be used for the purposes for which they were levied. If tax  officials continue to work normally, taxes will be collected by them in the  usual way. Otherwise, the occupying power may impose an obligation  on each local authority to collect and pay a proportion of total revenue.  The occupying power can levy contributions from the inhabitants, which  may only be applied to the needs of the occupying forces or to the adminis-  tration of the territory and only in so far as those requirements are not  met by existing taxation. Funds raised must not be used for the enrichment  of the occupying power or its personnel,57 nor be used as a collective punishment.58 Contributions from towns and productive areas may be  used to support poorer areas. Contributions may only be collected on the  written order of the commander-in-chief of the occupying forces.  Generally, fund-raising must accord as far as possible with the system for  assessing taxes in the occupied territory. A receipt must be given to each  individual contributor.59  11.29  11.30  11.31  Occupied Territory  285  11.28  55 Judgment of the International Military Tribunal sitting at Nuremberg, Trial of the Major""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 383.pdf, page 334: ""The occupying power may introduce new criminal laws as necessary to  enable it to fulfil its international obligations, maintain orderly govern-  ment, and ensure the security of the occupying power, its forces, adminis-  tration, establishments, and lines of communication.98  Publication of new legislation  New criminal law enacted by the occupying power comes into force only  after it has been duly published to the inhabitants in writing in their own  language. It must not be retroactive.99  Competent courts  The occupying power may set up its own non-political, military courts to  try offences created by its own legislation. These courts, sometimes known  as occupation courts, are in addition to the existing criminal courts and  others that have to be established by the occupying power to administer the  law of the occupied territory if officials and judges have left their posts.  Occupation courts must sit in the occupied territory. So, whenever possible,  should courts dealing with appeals from occupation courts.100  The rule set out in paragraph 11.59 prohibits the occupying power from  extending its own civil court system to occupied territory. The occupation  courts may consist of either military or civilian judges, but they must be  responsible to the military authorities of the occupying power. If they are  authorized to do so in accordance with laws made by the occupying power,  these courts may also try cases of alleged war crimes.101 All of these courts  are subject to the rules set out in paragraphs 9.6 and 11.60 to 11.74.  Applicable law  Occupation courts may only apply those provisions of law applicable at the  time of the commission of the offence and which accord with general prin-  ciples of law and with human rights guarantees in the occupant’s law and  human rights instruments by which the occupying power is bound.102 In the  absence of more specific rules, the principles in the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights 1948 will apply. In particular, the penalty must be propor-  tionate to the offence. Courts must also take into account the fact that the  accused is not a national of the occupying power.103  JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict  294  11.57  11.58  11.59  11.59.1  11.60  98 GC IV, Art 64.  99 GC IV, Art 65.  100 GC IV, Art 66.  101 MML III, para 568.

Original Original  In some cases, occupying troops have operated indirectly through an existing  or newly appointed indigenous government. This type of occupation is not discussed in detail in this chapter. In such cases, despite certain differ-  ences from the classic form of military occupation, the law relating to military occupation is likely to be applicable. Legal obligations, policy  considerations, and external diplomatic pressures may all point to this  conclusion.  Patrols, commando, and similar units, which move on or withdraw after  carrying out their mission, do not normally occupy territory since they are  not there long enough to set up an administration. The use of airborne forces  and of mechanized warfare may make it difficult to determine whether  occupation exists. When hostilities continue in enemy territory, occupation  only arises in areas coming under the control of the adverse party, even if  that control is only temporary, provided that measures are taken to admin-  ister the areas in question. Occupation does not take effect merely because  the main forces of the country have been defeated but depends on whether  authority is actually being exercised over the civilian population. However,  for occupation of an area it is not necessary to keep troops permanently  stationed throughout that area. It is sufficient that the national forces have  withdrawn, that the inhabitants have been disarmed, that measures have  been taken to protect life and property and to secure order, and that troops  are available, if necessary to enforce authority in the area. The existence  within an occupied area of a defended zone makes no difference so long as it  is surrounded and effectively cut-off.  In cases where two or more states jointly occupy territory (following a coalition military campaign, for example), it is desirable that there be  an agreement between them setting out the relationship between the  occupying powers.  Proclamation of Occupation  Mere proclamation of occupation is insufficient to bring an occupation into  existence. The test in paragraph 11.3 must be satisfied.  Although not strictly necessary in law, a proclamation should be issued to""  ', '']"
56,What is the origin of 'command responsibility'?,"The concept of command responsibility was first enunciated in the case of General Yamashita, where he was held to have failed to exercise effective control of his troops who were carrying out widespread atrocities in the Philippines (JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, 16.36.1). The Tribunal held that a commander was considered responsible if they had actual knowledge or should have known through reports received by them or other means about the commission or imminent commission of such crimes (JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict, 16.36.1, citing Manual of Military Law, Part III of 1958, para 631)","['This passage is from JSP 383.pdf, page 492: ""were about to be committed and failed ‘to take all necessary and reasonable  measures within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission  or to submit the matter to the competent authority for investigation and  prosecution’.170  The concept of command responsibility was first enunciated in the case of  General Yamashita.171 In that case, General Yamashita was held to have  failed to exercise ‘effective control’ of his troops who were carrying out  widespread atrocities in the Philippines. The Tribunal held that the nature  of the crimes themselves provided prima facie evidence of knowledge and  laid down a test that was reflected in the text of the Manual of Military Law  Part III of 1958. According to that test, a commander was considered res-  ponsible if ‘he has actual knowledge or should have knowledge, through  reports received by him or through other means’.172  The Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  dealt with command responsibility as follows:  the fact that any of the acts .was committed by a subordinate does not relieve  his superior of criminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to know that the  JSP 383: Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict  438  16.35.3  16.36  16.36.1  167 Art 25, para 3.  168 See para 16.47.  169 HC IV, Art 3; GC I, Art 49; GC II, Art 50; GC III, Art 129; GC IV, Arts 29 and 146; API, Art 91.  170 Rome Statute, Art 28; see also AP I, Art 86(2).  171 Case of General Yamashita (1946) AD Case No 111.

Army Field Manual (AFM) Command Command States: 1-38. A common understanding of the degrees of authority is a prerequisite for effective cooperation. Command arrangements must always be qualified by the DTG at which they begin. They should also specify the DTG at which they are likely to end and must accommodate the situation prior to and after transfer of authority (TOA). Note that when working in a multinational environment, the authority granted through command states must be clarified with the issuing commander. 1-39. Command States explain the status of formations, units and commanders, relative to each other. States of command are concerned primarily with the ability to assign an independent mission, to reorganise a unit to suit its task, or to direct specific tasks within an agreed mission. They exist in order to: a. Allow a higher headquarters to prioritise resources and effort. b. Protect the integrity of force structures and where appropriate to protect the independence of non-organic forces. c. Assist with force packaging when working with limited resources. In general, the command state should be set at the highest level possible, whereas control should be held at the lowest level possible. Control at too high a level can result in a loss of flexibility and tempo. Conversely, command at too low a level can result in the inability to concentrate resources and will hamper the ability to rapidly switch priorities. 1-40. Full Command (FULLCOM). FULLCOM is the military authority and responsibility of a commander to issue orders to subordinates. It covers every aspect of military operations and administration and exists only within national Services. The term \'command\', as used internationally, implies a lesser degree of authority than when it is used in a purely national sense. No NATO or coalition commander has FULLCOM over the assigned forces of other nations. Only OPCOM or OPCON (see below) can be delegated across national lines. 1-41. Operational and Tactical Command States: a. Operational Command (OPCOM). OPCOM is the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units and to reassign forces and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as may be necessary. It the authority to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned. It does not include responsibility for administration or logistics (see ADCON, below).""

Therefore, this chapter defines the responsibility of a commander, manager or accountable person as someone who has a delegated managerial or supervisory responsibility for activities or equipment that may result in the exposure of Defence personnel to excessive noise whilst at work. The noise levels must be managed through the use of control measures to reduce exposure to a level that is ALARP and tolerable. This includes design of equipment at the procurement stage to prevent or minimise noise exposure to levels that are ALARP and tolerable. 23. The above definitions imply that there will likely be several individuals who together share responsibility for reducing noise exposure. All personnel have a duty to work together to assess the risks and to make sure Defence is compliant with the policy statements in this chapter and therefore the legislation. 24. Whilst the primary responsibility for the welfare and H&S of personnel rests immediately with the commanders, managers or accountable persons of those personnel, this duty usually cannot be discharged without the proactive actions of other managers or responsible people. This can take the form of procuring equipment that is inherently of low noise design, directly supporting implementation of suitable measures, review and audit of an action plan, enforcing culture, standards of behaviour and adherence to policy, and so on. 25. The commander, manager or accountable person should first look at the site hazard assessment or safety case report, which should have identified the areas where work activities could produce excessive noise. 26. In each of these areas an initial assessment must be carried out to identify whether there is a potential noise hazard and whether a more detailed noise assessment may be required. A ‘Noise Hazard Check Questionnaire’ (NHCQ) is designed for this purpose and is presented in Annex C to this chapter. 27. The commander, manager or accountable person should make sure that an NHCQ is carried out by or in conjunction with a person familiar with the work environment and processes. The person does not need to have had noise assessor training to undertake this task. 28. If the NHCQ identifies a noise hazard, the commander, manager or accountable person must arrange for a detailed noise assessment to be carried out following the guidance in Annex B of this chapter. 29. A CP can assist the commander, manager or accountable person with the development of the action plan to limit the findings of the noise risk assessment. 30. Suitable control measures must be developed in consultation with personnel and where appropriate Trade Union appointed and / or employee safety representatives. 31.

58,What is the approval process for disposal of radioactive waste?,"To dispose of radioactive waste, an approval must be received from the appropriate environment agency (Annex 17 in JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 4). The application for approval should be coordinated through Dstl, and TLBs are required to make arrangements for necessary payments and annual subsistence charges. In some cases, MOD establishments with their own resident RWA may apply directly to the environment agency concerned while keeping Dstl informed (Annex 17 in JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 4). Approval documents provided by the environment agencies via Dstl are to be held by the unit or establishment, and approval holders and operators must appoint an RWA for consultation on various matters related to radioactive waste management (Annex 20 in JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 4). For exempt radioactive waste, disposal should be carried out as soon as practicable, and approval may be required for the accumulation of waste over a longer period if disposal within the timescale is not practicable (Annex 23 in JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 4)","['This passage is from JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 4: "". Agreement to accumulate waste is required from the appropriate TLB Safety Authority who will then instruct Dstl to obtain an approval. 25.

Where it is necessary to accumulate waste, the waste should be stored in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 9 and comply with the requirements of any conditions set out in the approval.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 5: ""Disposal Arrangements 26. Unless an exemption applies, discharge or disposal of radioactive waste can only take place after an approval has been received. The disposal must take place in accordance with the conditions of the approval. 27. Once a unit or establishment has no further requirement for an approval to accumulate and / or of radioactive waste, they are to inform the TLB Authority and Dstl, who will initiate proceedings to cancel / surrender the approval. 28. Values of concentrations and quantities of exempt solid radioactive waste as stated in national legislation are reproduced at Annex A. Advice on the application of this table and the exemption limits that apply to liquids and NORM waste as well-as full details of the exemption conditions that apply (which vary depending upon the type of exempt waste) should be sought from your appointed RPA or an RWA. 29. In general, the following exemption provisions must be complied with when disposing of low volume VLLW: a. waste must be transferred to: (1) a person who disposes of substantial quantities of non-radioactive waste for burial in landfill, incineration or recovery (which, for example, includes recycling and recovery of metals) and where the radioactive waste will be mixed with non-radioactive waste; and (2) a person with a Permit to receive such waste. b. a record must be kept indefinitely of the radioactive material (description, nuclide and activity) that has been disposed of including the date of disposal and the disposal route used; and c. ensure that where practicable any marking or labelling of the waste or its container is removed before it is disposed of. 30. All sealed sources that exceed the limit in Annex A (including HASS etc.), tritium foil sources and electrodeposited sources can be disposed of without the need for an Approval, subject to compliance with certain conditions. The source must be disposed of via a person or organisation who is authorised under EPR16/EASR18/RSA93 to dispose of similar material. Additional advice on the disposal of such sources should be sought an RWA. 31. Large quantities of very low-level radioactive waste (the exemption provisions apply only to low volume VLLW) or exempt wastes such as thoriated engine casings should be disposed of through the Defence Equipment Sales Authority (DESA), MOD’s central contract for the disposal of hazardous and special wastes. The appointed RPA will advise on whether this route or direct disposal via a waste contractor is most appropriate. Further details can be obtained from the DESA. 32. Spoil from the remediation of sites should be disposed of through DIO or a DIO approved contractor (see Chapter 13). 33. It should be noted that High Activity Sealed Sources (HASS) should not normally be disposed of but will generally be transferred to an organisation approved to accept such""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 3: ""determine which category applies to obsolete equipment containing radioactive substances that are going to be disposed of or equipment incorporating radioactive substances which has become damaged and can be disposed of locally at unit level. 13. There are instances, such as in the decommissioning of facilities / equipment or following a spillage or radioactive material, where items (e.g. tools, bricks etc) or materials (e.g. soil) may be found to be contaminated or potentially contaminated with low levels of radiation. In these situations, it is important to correctly quantify the degree of contamination so that the most appropriate disposal routes can be identified. In such circumstances the appointed RPA or an RWA should be consulted. 14. To support this, the MOD has contributed to the Code of Practice (COP) Clearance and Exemption Principles, Processes and Practices for use by the Nuclear Industry – Issue 2. This document sets out industry good practice for identifying and sentencing exempt radioactive material1. 15. The COP interprets current legislation and provides, through the use of flow charts, clear guidance for commonly found material types. Those seeking to manage the waste disposal process, working with their RPA and RWA, should incorporate the requirements of the COP into local procedures and practices for the disposal, re-use or recycling of radioactive material. 16. Following local procedures that incorporate the principles of the COP will generally be sufficient to enable individual units and establishments to demonstrate that material is being appropriately sentenced in compliance with legislative and MOD requirements. Application for Approval to Dispose of Radioactive Waste Above Exemption Levels 17. No radioactive waste disposals other than those covered by an appropriate exemption are to be made without first obtaining an approval from the appropriate environment agency. Advice on the arrangements for disposal of radioactive material through an approved route should be sought from an RWA. 18. In addition to the requirement to keep any radiation exposure as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) under IRR17 the process of seeking an approval from the environmental agencies will require an assessment to be made, as part of the planning process for radiation protection, to determine whether the following maximum doses could be received by individuals as a result of the planned activity: a. 0.3 mSv per year from any source from which radioactive discharges are first made on or after 13th May 2000; and b. 0.5 mSv per year from the discharges from any single site. 19. Radioactive Waste Advisers can advise on all matters related to the management of radioactive waste. It is a condition of the approvals granted by the environment agencies that Approval Holders and Operators (in this case the MOD) appoint in writing an RWA. An RWA must be consulted on the following matters: a""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 12.pdf, page 4: ""b. checking the effectiveness of technical devices for protecting the environment and the population; c. acceptance into service, from the point of view of surveillance of radiation protection, of equipment and procedures for measuring and assessing, as appropriate, exposure and radioactive contamination of the environment and the population; and d. regular calibration of measuring instruments and regular checking that they are serviceable and correctly used. 20. Significant input will be required from the RWA in determining the radiological impact of the direct disposals of radioactive waste to the environment and in ensuring that the process employed in accumulating and / or disposing of radioactive waste is optimised such that the best available technique is being implemented to the extent that exposures to the environment are reduced to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable. 21. In most circumstances applications to the environment agencies are co-ordinated through Dstl. TLBs are required to make arrangements for the necessary payments for applications and subsequent annual subsistence charges. MOD establishments with their own resident RWA may apply directly to the environment agency concerned, but must keep Dstl informed by letter, as detailed in Chapter 3 to ensure that funding arrangements are put in place. MOD establishment that are (nuclear) Authorised Sites will liaise with the environment agencies directly. 22. Approval documents provided by the environment agencies via Dstl are to be held by the unit or establishment. Unless otherwise stated as a condition in the approval or approval and notification, these documents must not be displayed on any notice board. MOD (Army) establishments are to send an additional copy to CESO (Army). Accumulation of Radioactive Waste 23. In most circumstances exempt radioactive waste should be disposed of as soon as practicable. Regulator guidance states that establishments and units making use of the Very Low-Level Waste (VLLW) Exemption provisions should not hold onto waste items for a period exceeding the next waste collection; therefore, exempt VLLW such waste shouldn’t be accumulated for more than a few weeks. In the case of sealed sources (excluding HASS and sources of similar potential hazard), electrodeposited sources and tritium foil sources (above certain threshold limits – see Annex A rows 3 and 4) these items may be accumulated for a period of up to twenty-six weeks. This timeframe allows for the arrangements of contract to transfer this type of waste to a waste permitted person. 24. Where disposal within this timescale would not be practicable an approval for the accumulation of waste over a longer period must be obtained from the appropriate environment agency. Agreement to accumulate waste is required from the appropriate TLB Safety Authority who will then instruct Dstl to obtain an approval. 25""  ', '']"

The fluoroscope is not to be operated until any deficiencies identified in the initial inspection have been repaired by a suitably qualified person, and the fluoroscope has been re-inspected and monitored. Maintenance 21. The employer must ensure that engineering controls, design features, safety features and warning devices are properly maintained, examined and tested at suitable intervals (typically annually). The employer is to arrange maintenance and testing in accordance with the manufacturer’s information, Chapter 8 (Radiation Monitoring Instruments) and the advice of the RPA. 22. Records must be kept of the examinations and tests to identify if any faults were found, how they were rectified and when the next examination or test is due. 23. In many cases, it is permissible for employers to hand-over the area in which the equipment is housed to maintenance staff. In this case, the employer is to ensure that suitably competent staff will undertake the maintenance / repair and that it is clear that the maintenance employer has control of the area – the maintainer is to then operate to their own local orders. If this arrangement is inappropriate, then the employer retains all safety responsibilities and must ensure that local orders are adequate to cover the maintenance task and that appropriate training of their own supervisory staff has been carried out. If the maintenance requires area designation, then an RPA must be consulted. Operating instructions 24. A set of operating instructions is to be drawn up by the unit or establishment for each fluoroscope. Each operator is to comply with the operating instructions. Local Orders for Radiation Safety 25. The requirements for radiation safety are to be drawn up in accordance with Chapter 16. The local orders are to include the requirements for periodic radiation surveys, as advised by the manufacturer or RPA, and are also to specify dose rate action levels. RPA advice is to be sought regarding the action levels and the action to be taken if they are exceeded. Security 26. The equipment is to be kept locked and secured when not in use. If key controlled, the key is to be kept in safe custody; the names of persons authorised to draw the key are to be recorded. General Safety Requirements 27. Where reasonably practicable, fluoroscopes are to be fitted with interlocks to prevent access to the examination compartment during X-ray emission. 28. The condition of lead impregnated rubber curtains is to be checked regularly. Any damaged curtains are to be repaired or replaced immediately.  29. Fluoroscopes are to have viewing facilities which do not permit direct viewing of the fluoroscopy screen. 30. No alterations or additions are to be made to fluoroscopes after installation except by qualified, authorised staff.""

Where users carry out maintenance or inspection tasks which require the equipment to be powered up, account must be taken of the increased hazard faced by maintainers. The increased hazard may be due to the need for access to components which are normally shielded or due to the need for a maintainer to be positioned closer to the source of ionising radiation than is necessary during normal operation. These issues must be carefully considered in the risk assessment and appropriate measures to restrict exposure introduced. Such measures must be described in local orders for radiation safety (see Chapter 16) and must also be included in the training of maintainers.""

The installer of equipment operating at more than 5 kV and where ionising radiation could be emitted has a number of duties imposed by IRR17, in particular: a. they must carry out a critical examination of the way in which the equipment has been installed ensuring that safety features and warning devices operate correctly and that there is sufficient protection for persons from exposure to ionising radiation; b. they must consult with their RPA or with the operator’s RPA with regard to the extent of the critical examination and in regard to the results of that examination; and c. they must provide the employer (the employer being the operator of the equipment e.g. the CO, Head of Establishment) with adequate information about proper use, testing and maintenance of the equipment. 15. The employer must consult their RPA regarding the plans for installing the equipment in relation to engineering controls, design features, safety features and warning devices. They are also to consult the RPA regarding the acceptability of the test results of the critical examination and the requirements and results of any further commissioning tests or radiation surveys. 16.

Protection against Parasitic X-Ray Emissions 18. X-ray emissions identified by a unit or establishment that are not referred to in the equipment handbook are to be reported to the equipment sponsor, the appropriate TLB safety authority and the RPA (Dstl). 19. Sponsors of equipments producing parasitic X-ray emissions are, where reasonably practicable, to introduce modifications to minimise the hazard to personnel. This may be by the provision of shielding around the equipment or part of the equipment which generates the parasitic X-rays. 20. Where removable radiation shielding is provided, it is to be used as directed in the equipment handbook. Such shielding is to be marked to indicate the presence of an increased radiation hazard if it is removed. Equipment’s with removable shielding are to, whenever practicable, be fitted with engineered controls e.g. interlocks to prevent the equipment from operating when the shielding is removed.""  ', '']"

Wavelengths in the UV region are primarily absorbed by the cornea, resulting in photo-keratitis (or snow blindness) where exposure is excessive. Exposure to visible laser radiation can cause thermal injuries to the retina and overexposure to infra red (IR) laser radiation can result in corneal burns and cataracts. There is also a risk of skin damage such as skin burns from higher power lasers.

However, flank lanes are not to be used and engagement of targets closer than 25m is prohibited. Additionally, ranges with dense rubber tiles fitted on the mantlet are suitable for shotgun practices (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15.pdf, page 1, paragraph 1508c)","['This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15.pdf, page 1: ""The Gallery Range JSP 403 Volume 2 Edition 3 Change 6 Amnd 2 1507. Other Factors a. Burst Fire. The rules for burst fire are given in Reference B (Pamphlet 21). b. Moving Targets. The use of moving targets on a LDA (GR) type range is normally restricted to one 2.4m run at the centre of a 12 lane range. Advice from TAS(RE) should be sought if targets for more than one firer are required c. 200 Mil Rule. This reduction from the GR RDA is authorised only between a split or two standard GR / CGR or ET(LDA)R. On these ranges ground ricochet is limited by elevating the targets on top of a mantlet. With reduced ground ricochet a reduction in the flank safety angle (the 200mil Rule) may be applied. For details on the use of 200 mil rule refer to Reference B (Pamphlet 21). The 200 mil rule is not to be applied when ranges are used by non service organisations or when advanced tactical practices are in progress. 1508. Practices on Gallery Ranges. a. Pistol Practices on a GR. The accepted location for targets engaged on standard GR pistol practices, from firing positions between the gallery and the stop butt, is at the bottom of the stop butt. On ranges where there is insufficient room between the gallery and the stop butt for pistol practices, targets mounted in front of the mantlet may be engaged. In such cases where the gallery detail between the stop butt and gallery is non standard, advice from TAS(RE) should be sought to ensure the pistol template is contained within the gallery RDA. In all cases the pistol 135mils template is to be applied to ensure flank firing position templates are contained within the range RDA. b. Combat Shotgun Practices on GR. Where the WDA can be accommodated (see Figures 19-7 and 19 – 8). Combat shotgun (slug and buckshot) may be fired at targets in lane mounted on the range floor in front of the mantlet. Flank lanes are not to be used. No engagement of targets closer than 25m. Those ranges with dense rubber tiles fitted on the mantlet are also suitable for shotgun practices. c. Sniper Practices.

General. A Gallery Range (GR) is an open LDA range originally constructed to imperial dimensions in yards (yds) or subsequently converted or partially converted to metres (m) with firing points at 100 intervals normally up to 600. On some ranges the 100 - 400 firing points only are converted to metric. For ease of reference firing points will be referred to as 100, 200 etc with no suffix. This range has a markers\' gallery and a stop butt. The common range layout has 12 firing lanes each 4m wide. Targets are manually operated by the markers in the butts. 1502. Aim.

A GR is suitable for practices at recruit and trained soldier level as set out in Reference C (Army Operational Shooting). Weapons typically used on this range include rifle, LSW, LMG, GPMG, SMG, and pistol. Tracer ammunition may also be used under the conditions set out in paragraph 1506. Due to the revised pistol practices using the manlet on GR  JSP 403 Volume 2 The Gallery Range Edition 3 Change 6 Amnd 2 or Gallery Type ranges should be confirmed by TAS(RE). Combat shotgun may be used on this range providing the wider WDA can be accommodated, see paragraph 1508b. AOSP 2010 introduces many more practices forward of the 100 firing point into targets mounted in front of the mantlet such as that used with LNV practices. See paragraph 1507c. DANGER AREAS 1504. DA Categories. Five DA may be applied to a GR a. Gallery Range Danger Area Template. The template shown in Figure 15-1 is applied to GR that conform to the requirements of this chapter. There is a limiting QEmax of 70 mils (3.94o) for GR with 1.8m mantlet / 3.05m determined stop butt as the design allows some rounds to pass over the stop butt. Where the QEmax is limited to 70 mils, rounds will fall inside the RDA. A QEmax of 70mils equates to a QEtch of 30mils (1.690). It is the QEtch that can be measured on site. b. Weapon Danger Area Template. The template shown in Figure 19-2, in accordance with the CofF for fixed ranges (see Chapter 2 Table 3), is used when the stop butt and mantlet design criteria cannot be met, or hard ricochet inducing surfaces exist, and for falling plate practices which do not conform to the standards set out in this JSP. This template may also be applied to those imperial GR where the QE exceeds 70mils. c. Combined Gallery Danger Area Trace. The templates at sub-""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15.pdf, page 1: ""The Gallery Range JSP 403 Volume 2 Edition 3 Change 6 mantlet. The face of the mantlet should match the range floor. In accordance with Health and Safety at Work Regulations, protection for maintenance staff should be provided where there is an open drop into the gallery. The minimum measure is a steep drop warning sign at each end of the mantlet. The type protection provided on the mantlet is to be dictated by local risk assessment based on the degree of permitted and unauthorised access onto the mantlet. 1529. Construction Of Shoot In Boxes. Shooting in boxes are provided to take the majority of rounds fired during 50 m ACQM shoots and as such need to be constructed around each target array. The boxes are to be made of a soft material such as timber that will not generate hard ricochet. There will always be wide shot that will damage the materials used in constructing these boxes so this should be taken into consideration when choosing the material used. Also on ranges where LMG or GPMG are used extensively, attrition on the mantlet may be high. Refer also to Reference B that describes the use of plastic timber. Targets are normally positioned in pairs within a 4 m lane on Gallery Ranges. Mantlets vary greatly in layout so the actual size and position of shooting in boxes may vary from range to range; a typical layout is shown below: 1530. Falling Plate Targets. Falling plate shooting-in boxes set into the face of the mantlet lower the CofF, which increases the risk of ricochet off the range floor and therefore requires the 2900 m RDA template to be applied (see Figure 19-2). To avoid lowering the CofF, shooting-in boxes may be set into the stop butt between target frames on the normal LofS. However, as this creates a backsplash hazard, the markers\' gallery should not to be manned. To fire falling plate practices on gallery ranges without the need to increase the Gallery RDA, falling plate boxes or covers over the steel plates mounted on the mantlet may be used (5.56 mm only; refer to TAS for details). Only the issued falling plate targets are to be used (see Chapter 29).""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15.pdf, page 5: "". The space can also be used for shooting at 25 m provided the stop butt meets the criteria in this Chapter, and there is sufficient land beyond the GR flank RDA for the pistol WDA. In this case provision for targetry at the base of the stop butt may be considered. Refer to TAS(RE) to determine the pistol WDA required based on flank target positions. On ranges where the stop butt is less than 25m provision must be made to prevent backsplash into the gallery. See Chapter 2 Table 2.""  ', '']"
67,What are the main features of a bullet catcher constructed from sand?,"According to the provided reference text in JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, a bullet catcher constructed from sand should have the following main features:

* Conforms to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"" with angular shape for slope stability and sound physical properties.
* Depth of sand is related to the type of weapon fired, with high velocity weapons requiring a depth of 1000 mm (S) 900 mm (C), and low velocity weapons requiring a depth of 750 mm (S) 500 mm (C).
* The front face of the bullet catcher should have a recommended slope of 340 (600 mils) to reduce the risk of ricochet.
* Regular maintenance is essential, including raking the sand to prevent tunneling and restore the profile to the specified slope.
* Sand in the bullet catcher is to be kept loose to prevent settling below the recommended slope, which may cause ricochet.

General. Sand has been generally used in bullet catchers and stop butts on many of the ranges described in this Volume. This section specifies the quality of the sand, its profile and maintenance that are necessary to capture shot without causing ricochet or backsplash. Wet sand will have the tendency to form tunnelling on ranges where tight grouping is expected which may result in penetration of the bullet catcher. 02111. Quality. It is recommended that sand conforming to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"". Grading should conform to BSI PD 6682-1 Table D1, ""0/4 Concrete Sand CP"" with angular shape for slope stability and sound physical properties to resist natural breakdown.\' This grade is fine enough not to cause ricochet yet coarse enough to retain the required profile effectively without likelihood of setting or forming a surface crust; it is also relatively stable in high winds. This specification also provides for a material that will not readily breakdown naturally, such material should not crush to fine dust when rubbed between the hands. Over time bullets pounding the sand reduce it to fine dust behind the MPI, at this point the sand will need to be replaced. 02112. Construction. The core of the bullet catcher or stop butt may be constructed of any stable inert fill material. However, the surface is to be covered by sand as specified in the relevant Chapter for the range. Generally the depth of sand is related to the type of weapon fired. For high velocity weapons (see Table 4), the depth of sand measured on a line parallel to the LofS should be 1000 mm (S) 900 mm (C) For low velocity weapons the depth should also be 750 mm (S) 500 mm (C) in the direction of the line of fire. 02113. Profile. 340 (600 mils) (C) is the recommended slope for the front face of the bullet catcher in order to reduce the risk of ricochet. Rounds impacting into, or the natural settlement of the sand, may reduce the slope which must never be allowed to fall below 300 (530 mils) (C); as this may cause ricochet to leave the RDA. 02114. Maintenance. Regular maintenance of the sand is essential to the range remaining safe for use. There are several factors to be considered and these are described below. Renewal or replacement of the sand may be achieved by rotating the sand in situ or by replacing it with sand from another section of the bullet catcher. The following measures are particularly important. a. Profile. Sand in the bullet catcher is to be raked to prevent tunnelling at the MPI behind targets to keep the surface of the sand in a loose state and to restore the profile to the slope stated in paragraph 02113.

Traditional sand bank with canopy or 100m Range Danger Area. The traditional sand bullet catcher with a 900 mm depth of sand at 34° (600 mils) is a safe, reliable and proven design. It is safe for automatic fire in short bursts. To capture high angle ricochet and 7.62mm pop over, a canopy of minimum 180mm thick timber (rail sleeper) or steel plate should cover the target area. If there is sufficient space, a 100m RDA may eliminate the requirement for a canopy. Section 2 – Typical bullet trap using sand natural angle of repose (30 – 34deg) 1151. Target Selection. When selecting targets and target mechanisms, the difficulty of moving down the range to mark or change targets should be borne in mind as target retrieval systems cannot easily be installed in the tube. An automatic marking system and a simple turning target mechanism will greatly enhance the range and the training value. Fall-when-hit systems are difficult on a tube range as the concentration of the sound energy in the tube may activate the mechanism without the target being struck. The Figure 11 remains the target of choice for military practices but requires a large diameter tube. Representative targets, sized to give the appearance of targets at greater ranges provide valuable training on shorter ranges. To minimise the risk of ricochet off the tube walls, targets must be presented centrally in the tube. Multi-point targets should not be used unless the range has been specifically designed for this type of target. 1152. Ricochet and Backsplash. Refer to paragraph1110. 1153. Target Illumination.

The Sand Bullet Catcher. The traditional sand faced bullet catcher is ballistically suitable for all weapons. Details of sand bullet catchers are provided in Chapter 2. It is however not the ideal solution indoors due to the dust and cleaning problems associated with such traps. 0325. Vertical Steel Plate with Anti-Splash Curtain. Existing low velocity ranges traditionally have the minimum requirements outlined in Figure 3-5. In this case the bullet catcher and the backplate are to be firmly fixed to a sound brick, blockwork or concrete wall. Steel plates should be mounted so that sheets are flush to each other, preferably with fixings made flush. The bullet catcher plates should be so arranged that the target positions will not coincide with the edges of the steel sheet. This design is the minimum requirement for rimfire weapons. It is simple and reliable, and breaks up the round on impact. Backsplash is prevented by an anti-splash curtain in front of the plate. A timber batten on the floor behind the curtain helps contain lead fragments. The main disadvantage of this trap is noise and the lead dust generated by bullet impact on the steel plate. The size and thickness of steel plate may be determined from Chapter 2 Tables 6 and 7. To minimise reverberation and noise when the bullet catcher is struck, an absorbent layer should be sandwiched between the steel sheet and the back wall. A sacrificial plate will increase durability at the MPI, especially if centrefire pistol is to be fired. As continued strike will buckle this plate, it should be fixed to allow for creep. Fixing bolts and screws should be countersunk. 0326. Angled Steel Plate with Anti-Splash Curtain. A single steel plate deflects rounds downwards to a bullet stop at floor level. It is effective but less safe and reliable than the vertical plate. Deflected rounds may not behave in a predictable manner and there is a much higher reliance placed on the anti-splash curtain. Multiple deflectors of the ""Venetian blind"" type are only to be used with an anti-splash curtain fixed in front of and clear of the bullet catcher. 0327. Snail Bullet Trap. This trap is a patent design by Savage Arms Corps of USA and is suitable for all lead based ammunition types. During 2006 the specification of the “Snail” trap has been upgraded to cater for the introduction of steel ammunition. The use of steel ammunition in existing “Snail” traps should not cause sudden failure but inspection of the impact surfaces in the throat of the trap will be necessary to ensure wear is not taking place. The bullet catcher works by directing the bullet into a tight spin allowing the round to decelerate whilst contained within the trap. Lead dust is still produced but is contained. Noise remains a problem with this type of catcher. Such catchers once properly installed should need little maintenance""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2.pdf, page 37: "".

JSP 403 Volume 2 Range design criteria and specifications Edition 3 Change 6 Amnd 1 (3) Netting. Mesh netting or geogrid, may be used to reinforce the face angle. The mesh is placed just below the surface of the sand and is held in place with wooden pegs. Light galvanised wire mesh may also be used as it is effective against burrowing rabbits. (4) Timber support. Timber supports in the form of boxes or herringbone within the sand clear of the MPI can assist the retention of the sand profile. d. Cleaning. Sand bullet catchers should be checked at least weekly to ensure surface bullet debris is removed and de-leaded as described previously. Local RAO representative may extend the period between de-leading where it is safe to do so. Rotation of the sand within the bullet catcher may prolong the life of the sand. The sand should be replaced when the maintenance of the 340 face becomes difficult. The hazard of lead contamination when working on sand bullet traps must be considered. The RAU is responsible for: (1) Observing the requirements of the Control of Lead at Work Regulations. (2) The safety of working practices. (3) Providing the appropriate personal protective clothing and, when necessary, respiratory protective equipment. (4) Providing washing and changing areas which avoid cross-contamination of clothing. (5) Disposing sand, soil and debris, which might contain or be contaminated by lead, as contaminated waste in accordance with the Local Authority Environmental Control Department\'s instructions and MOD Policy. e. Black Powder Weapons. On ranges where firing black powder weapons is permitted, particular care is to be taken to avoid lead building up in the stop butt and mantlet. 02115 – 02119. spare GRANULATED RUBBER BULLET CATCHERS 02120.

Description. The basic training grenade range has up to three throwing bays. To the left of the bays is a troop assembly building and to the right a dispersal building for those who have practised. An impact area of approximately 41 x 21 m is forward of the throwing bays and behind them is a protected tower designed to provide clear unobstructed observation into the throwing bays and protection for the RCO. 2204. Purpose. This range is for initial and refresher training. It cannot provide realistic operational or advanced training. RANGE DANGER AREA 2205. The RDA has a radius of 250 m extending all round the impact area (see Figure 22-1). The current grenade, L109 has a danger area of 200m from point of detonation. The impact area must be open to view by the safety supervisors in the throwing bays. The DA should be clear and open to view from the RCO\'s control tower; where this is not possible control measures must be in place which allows the RCO to be confident that the DA is clear. It may be necessary to post sentries to cover blind spots. An area to the flanks of the prepared impact area extending 20m beyond the prepared impact area must be kept well maintained in order to locate and clear any blind grenade thrown wide. Movement within the RDA beyond the clear area is to be restricted due to the possibility of blinds unless that area can be cleared by the RCO following the destruction of a blind. When using red phosphorous grenades RCO’s must ensure the wind direction will not endanger those on the range as set out in Inf Trg Pam 13. DESIGN 2206. Design Criteria. The constructional details for the grenade range are shown in Figure 22-1. The range was designed for previous issue L2 grenade but is suitable for currently approved L109 Service hand grenades. The standard design includes sloping roofs on the assembly and dispersal buildings with the slope towards the throwing bay to avoid any ponding on the roof. Ponding can enhance the blast effect of grenades thrown onto these roofs and therefore could damage the roof. 2207. Siting. The range buildings and impact area require a reasonably level site as there must be no possibility of a grenade rolling after it lands whether deliberately thrown or accidentally dropped. The range should be sited away from roads and areas frequented by the public. The orientation of the range should be northerly so that the RCO is not looking into the sun. CONSTRUCTION RANGE FLOOR 2208. Impact Area. Targets, usually stick-in Figures 11 or 12, are set up on the impact area which is 41 m long by 21 m wide. The surface of the impact area is designed to minimise the blast and fragmentation effects of a detonating grenade.

Introduction. Grenade ranges not conforming to the current criteria for the Basic Grenade Range may be used to train soldiers in tactical grenade training, but only when the range conforms to the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2218 and 2219. The Exercise Director and Exercise Planning Staff are to ensure the use of any constructed tactical grenade facility is safe for the practices to be undertaken and sufficient protection is provided for both exercising troops and safety staff. CONSTRUCTION 2218. Field Firing Area Tactical Grenade Range. Tactical grenade practices do not necessarily require a constructed range as suitable natural cover may be used. However, an example of construction for a semi-permanent tactical throwing grenade trench is shown in Figure 22-2 with grenade posting trenches shown in Figures 22-3 to 22-5. The area around these facilities requires careful selection to ensure full protection for grenadiers and safety staff and to locate and dispose any blinds. The standard grenade range mitigates errors of drill but this margin of safety is not available for tactical throwing. The minimum safety standards for a LFTT tactical grenade range are: (a) Range Danger Area. A 250 m (200 m for L109) radius RDA around the impact area over which safety staff can exercise control. (b) Siting. The impact area must be dry and firm ground with no more than light vegetation. No trees, hanging branches rocks or any obstruction that might deflect the grenade should be between the throwing position and the targets. (c) Protection – Bunker and Shell Scrape. Sufficient natural or constructed cover for all troops, including sheltering troops in fighting order, within the RDA is to be equivalent to the illustration in Figure 22-5 at Section XX: (1) A minimum thickness of 750 mm of well compacted soil across the full height and width of the required cover. (2) A minimum height of 750 mm for protection in the prone position and 1200 mm for CQB ranges where grenades are thrown during clearance operations. (3) A minimum length of 1.5 m of protection is to be provided for each person taking cover. (4) The design of the target must take account of the possibility of a grenade exploding outside the target area due to error by the grenadier. When posting grenades through the front protection is to be narrow enough for the grenadier to easily drop the grenade into a trench. There is to be no netting or cam nets that could snag the throwing or posting arm. Suitable trench design can be supplied by CD Combat for the grenadier, cover man and Safety Supervisor.""

The hazard area is the area within which a specified hazard can be identified. A risk assessment defines what level of hazard is acceptable for a particular activity. The edge of the hazard area is the hazard boundary. Note: The assessor identifies and quantifies the hazard, the acceptor identifies and quantifies the level of risk. Hazard Boundary. The hazard boundary is the outer edge of the hazard area. It is deemed that at the boundary the risk from the defined hazard is as low as is reasonably practicable. Hazard Identification. Hazard identification is the process of recognising that a hazard exists and defining its characteristics. (P118(2)) Hazard Log. A hazard log is a record of the hazards associated with a specific project or activity and the methods by which they have been controlled.

Weapon Danger Area Template. The WDA template for the NLAW HEAT round is shown in Figure 24-4. a. Clear Zone. The clear zone extending 220 m forward from the firing point at an angle of 192 mils either side of the LofF is to be clear of all obstructions that may initiate the missile including targets, trees, shrubs or outcrops of rock. b. Backblast Area. The backblast area extends 100 m behind the firer over an arc 455 (800 mils) either side of the LofF. The area has to be flat or falling away from the firing point and completely clear of any obstructions. c. Burst Safety Distances. Behind each firing point and centred on the LofF are the N and RBSD with radii of 315 and 220 m respectively (see Figure 24-2). Refer to Reference B (Pamphlet 21) for the application of BSD. 2404. Impact Areas. Refer to Chapter 2. SITING 2405. The site for a LAW range has to ensure that: a. There is an unobstructed LofS from the firing bay to each target. b. Targets are positioned so that misses detonate on a stop butt or rising ground behind the target. c. The backblast area should have no obstructions. d. The RCO should be best positioned to conduct practice safely. CONSTRUCTION 2406. Targets. Targets will normally be AFV hulks but they may be solid simulations with a facing of a minimum thickness of 2.5 mm MS to ensure detonation. Further details of anti-tank targets and movers are contained in Chapter 29. No target may be less than 220 m from the firing bays, which is the minimum training engagement distance. Although battle engagement is possible up to 500 m, practice engagements with HEAT missiles do not normally exceed 300 m in order to increase the probability of hit. 2407. Initiating Stop Butt. There should be a bank or rising ground behind the targets to catch and initiate rounds which miss the target. If not, an initiating stop butt should be constructed at 270 mils (150) (S). Where topography inhibits locating blinds the risks should be assessed and consideration given to establishing a controlled or closed impact area (see Chapter 2). 2408. Range Floor. The range floor must provide a clear LofS to the target with no ridges or high points which could cause a missile to ground. Ideally it should be concave. Raising the target on a bank may also help. 2409. Firing Bays. Up to three bays, the maximum an RCO can control, may be provided. Bays are constructed to protect firers and safety supervisors from the effects of an in-flight premature detonation of the missile""  ', '']"

For targets located 150m or more from the firing point, a prepared area where all soft earth, reed, and tall grass has been removed should be sufficient. Imported stone or gravel should not contain large (> 30 mm) stones behind which blinds may lodge. Additionally, the UGL target should be buried up to 150 mm below the surface or the surface built up to achieve the same protection.

Chippings to be surrounded by treated timber boards, set on edge, to assist in retaining the shingle within the firing point area. 2809. Targetry. A target representing a bunker at an engagement distance of 150m or more for UGL HE DP is to be positioned within an impact area. Targets for the GMG are placed a minimum of 220 m from the firing point. The UGL target is to be of durable construction to ensure minimum maintenance while retaining a realistic appearance (see Figure 29-9). The target is to comprise the following elements: a. Armour Plate. To provide suitable durability and minimum maintenance, the target face is to be constructed as follows: (1) Dimensions. 2 m (T) wide, 1 m (T) high and 25 mm (T) thick, positioned approximately perpendicular to the ground level and LofF. (2) Materials. Rolled Homogenous Armour (RHA) steel plate with suitable supports to the rear of the armour plate to provide stability. The front face of the armour plate is to be painted to give the impression of a sandbag bunker. b. Earth Bank. An earth bank behind the armour plate to provide additional stability and to enhance the appearance may complicate the clearance of blinds should a grenade pass through a hole in the plate and not detonate. If a bank is considered necessary, it should be constructed clear of the steel plate so that blinds may be dealt with safely. To minimize the risk of UGL HE grenades getting under the steel plate as blinds, the plate should be buried up to 150 mm below the surface or the surface built up to achieve the same protection. 2810. UGL Target Area. To minimize the problems of locating blinds, the area around the target may be prepared to ensure detonation. For targets located 150m or more from the firing point a prepared area, illustrated in Figure 28-4 should be sufficient. A prepared area is one where all soft earth, reed and tall grass has been removed. In peaty areas imported stone or gravel will provide an adequate initiation surface. Imported stone or gravel should not contain large (> 30 mm) stone behind which blinds may lodge. 2811. Initiating Stop Butt. On ranges where depressed L of S with ground behind the target cannot be achieved, initiating stop butts may be constructed to capture rounds that miss the target. The dimensions of the initiating stop butt should be determined by the assessment of the RCO\'s ability to observe potential blinds that may fall behind the initiating stop butt. Where the RCO has an elevated observation point, an initiating stop butt should be constructed to the point where the RCO retains visibility of the impact area. Where the RCO will not be able to see the fall of rounds behind the target the initiating stop butt should be substantial to capture all shots""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 3.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 403 Volume 2 Indoor Ranges Edition 3 Change 6 d.

Where a range is used for air weapons it will be necessary to make provision to remove the backsplash curtain or fit an additional pellet catcher curtain of hessian or similar material. 0332. Pelmet. The pelmet is a timber shelf with side cheeks to prevent deflected rounds or backsplash escaping. The inner surfaces of the pelmet are lined with 3 mm thick steel to reduce the attrition caused by continued strike. 0333. Anti-Splash Curtain Repair. Latex rubber curtain is expensive. It can however have a very long service life, even on a heavily used range. The curtain should be moved around to prevent holing at MPI. Holes in the curtain can be patched once with material cut from another sheet and fixed with a suitable adhesive available from the manufacturer. Precautions must be taken when handling lead contaminated sheets. Latex rubber is inflammable and must be kept clear of heat sources such as target lights. 0334. Spare TARGETRY 0335. Targets. There are many target systems available for indoor ranges. Static projected target or scenic, video film or live relay and computer generated target arrays. Traditionally fixed target frames are fitted to most indoor ranges. However, the electrically operated turning target mechanism provides better training. A Figure 11 target or, ideally, two Figure 11 targets should be fitted per lane. A lane width of 1.6 m is required to give half target width separation within a lane and a full target width separation between lanes. If this cannot be achieved, Figure 11A or B targets can be substituted. Consideration should also be given in the design to NSRA multi point competition targets used in cadet ranges. 0336. Target Mechanisms. Target mechanisms should be protected against damage, backsplash and ricochet. The protection required is established from the worst case line of fire. Fixed target frames are locally manufactured. They should be of lightweight construction with no fixings that may cause ricochet or backsplash. Timber used should be softwood and the total thickness not greater than 25mm thick to ensure after penetration there is sufficient energy to penetrate the anti backsplash curtain. Many suitable fixing methods are available for target cards. A convenient target frame can be constructed with cellular plastic board. Further details may be obtained from TAS (RE). 0337.

Any paths provided are to be constructed of ricochet free material. 0818. Range Side Walls. The design provides for the addition of concrete side walls to the range. These are not essential beyond 11m but may be built if it is considered expedient to raise the confidence of people near the range. 0819. Fences and Signs. All access to the range when in use must be controlled. The standard range is enclosed with access for users at the rear of the range and vehicular access provided for range maintenance. Ranges that are in open access areas, particularly those where woods or shrubs come close to the stop butt or side of the range should be fenced and signed to ensure access during firing is controlled. The same measures will be necessary where ranges with sloping earth bunds protect the sides of the range. Local risk assessments will identify areas where access will need to be controlled. Where fences are deemed to be necessary prohibition signs will also be required. A flag pole for a red range in use flag is provided where it can best be seen.

In addition, to reduce ricochet, no ground or obstruction is to intrude into a line 450 mm below the prone firer\'s LofS. New firing points on the range floor between the 100 firing point and mantlet need only be marked with wooden pegs. In areas where the range floor may be eroded alternative materials may be incorporated such as those used on the main firing points. 1535. Surfaces. Firing point surfaces should be slip resistant, have no trip hazards and designed to minimise maintenance bearing in mind that they are exposed to shot from firing points to the rear. 1536. Fire Trenches. Properly drained fire trenches together with a post to simulate fire from cover are normally provided at the 100, 200 and 300 firing points but may not be possible if the water table is high. The trenches may be revetted with timber or pre-formed concrete sections with a 225 mm timber surround at the top to prevent ricochet.

The connections at the firing points are to be external weatherproof fittings located to the rear of the firing point. Preferably the connections are set below ground in a damp-proof container with a 50 mm thick timber lid set flush with the range floor. An above ground connection point should be provided on a pole set as low as possible but not more than 500 mm high protected by 100 mm thick timber or 500 mm of earth ramped up from the range floor. c.

Although these block the direct path of sound between weapon and complaint area, earth banks have a complicated effect: a. For example, the attenuation due to banks at 3 metres and 30 metres from the weapon would be 18dB and 9dB respectively. Should the side of the bank nearest the weapon be vertical the above attenuation would be reduced. b. A bank may however cut out, or reduce, the sound travelling close to the ground and hence reduce the ground absorption by about half. To gain 18dB attenuation by means of a bank 3 metres from the weapon, one could therefore lose between 22-5 and 25dB attenuation in lost ground absorption. This effect is uncertain, especially where the ground cover is bushy rather than grassy. c. The effect of a bank and its likely effect on ground absorption may be summarised as follows: Bank sited at 3m from weapon Frequency (Hz) 37-75 75-150 150-300 300-600 600-1200 Attenuation due To bank (dB) 9 12 15 18 21 Loss of ground absorption, in dB, due to bank: at 1500 m at 1650 m 2.3 2.5 7.5 8.3 17 19 22.5 25 17 19 Attenuation from earth banks.

At high frequencies absorption will be much higher, so much so that high frequency nuisance over these sample distances can be ignored. 3116. Temperature Gradients. These have effects like those of wind gradients and, similarly, are not as yet capable of prediction. An inversion may increase sound transmission but it is not known how often this condition may obtain in any given locale.

An example is given below of a theoretical prediction of sound attenuation, at distances of 1500 metres and 1650 metres from an SLR.

Hearing protection is to be worn on all firing points during practices. 2. The siting board is to ensure new ranges are sited as far away from populated areas or offices as possible. MOD freehold land around ranges extending for 300m (Nugent ruling) should be retained to preserve this separation from potential development. 3. For indoor ranges and non standard ranges with enclosed or semi enclosed firing points refer to Chapter 30. 4. Where 7.62mm is fired regularly (more than 50,000 rounds per lane per year) on a range into sand or earth stop butts the RAU should commission an analysis of the MPI to determine levels of antimony against current EU limits. 5. Where close engagement (15m or less) takes place on ranges with granulated rubber RAU should be aware that if the granulate is exposed it could absorb unburnt propellant that will increase the risk of fire. 02103. Noise. It is MOD policy that all those exposed to weapon noise must wear suitable hearing protection. There is a requirement to reduce noise levels further by applying additional control measures. Such control measures generally take the following two forms: a. Noise Containment. The building fabric, doors, ducting etc, are designed to reduce transmitting noise to the outside environment and to the surrounding structure. Dense materials should be selected for the building fabric of the firing points and bullet catcher chambers. Doors, ducts and other openings can be specified to give a similar level of noise insulation. See also Chapter 31. b. Noise Attenuation. The nature and treatment of internal surfaces are selected to attenuate reflected noise (reverberation) but these measures will not reduce the initial high level of noise produced by the weapon. There are many materials available, such as wood, wool slab, rockwool and glass fibre, which are very effective in reducing reflected noise. However, these materials will also harbour lead dust and unburnt propellant, and are difficult or impossible to clean as the fibrous materials are susceptible to damage. Whilst these materials may be suitable for ceilings, walls should be clad with a material which withstands knock and abrasion, and which can be appropriately cleaned. Granulated rubber tiles and tiles of resin bound flint sand have been found effective. Proper selection and detailing of the noise attenuation system will further enhance noise containment. Particular care is required for tube ranges. See also Chapter 31. 02104. Lead Pollution, Unburnt Propellant and Carbon Monoxide.

Therefore, the answer to this question is that the target should be at a height of 875mm in a 25m barrack range.

Where penetration is clearly greater than 10% from one strike refer to TAS(RE). c. Height. A standard wall height of 7.865 m applied with a flat range floor. The excavation of a ricochet pit enabled the height of the stop butt wall to be reduced; the reduction was equal to the depth of the pit but the wall height was not to be lower than 6.065 m. d. Compliance. The above is only valid for ranges that comply in all ballistic respects to the Standard Detail. In all other cases compliance is checked against Chapter 5. 0912. Bullet Catcher. A sand or granulated rubber bullet catcher is built over the entire central section of the stop butt wall. Its height is maintained at 2.3 m from the top of the target trench. The bullet catcher is built in the same way as that for the 25 m barrack range (see Chapter 8). 0913. Canopy. The canopy mentioned at paragraph 0906a should be added to all 25m barrack ranges. Otherwise a LDA is required in order to fire 7.62 mm and other high velocity ammunition that does not break up. The LDA has to extend laterally 100 m from each flank target, striking an arc to a line 100 m behind the stop butt in order to capture predicted pop-over. Without a canopy the range is classed as LDA (see Chapter 2). The facing edges of the canopy wing walls are to be protected with timber to prevent backsplash. 0914. Targets. The range may be used with all in-service figure and screen targets, including harmonisation, for SA (see Chapter 29). It is essential to the safety of this range that the target centre design height is maintained. Particular care is necessary when mounting harmonisation screens which must be located in sockets set lower down the mantlet. Where CQM shoots are authorised the RAU is to ensure all possible MPI falls within the bullet trap. The worst case practice will be CQM LFMT 3 m kneeling or squatting position. CQM shoots are not practical on ranges with a ricochet pit. 0915. Turning Target Mechanisms. The cable pull turning target mechanism originally provided on these ranges is difficult to operate and maintain. Two alternatives are available: a. Capstan Operated. See Chapter 29. b. Electrically Operated. These are described in Chapter 29. They may be permanently fitted and operated through a transformer to reduce mains electricity to 12 volts. Portable mechanisms require 12 volt batteries. Electrically, rather than capstan, operated is the system of choice as it is cheaper to buy and to install. Its speed and simplicity of operation improve the training value of the range. 0916. Target Positions. The number of targets per lane may be varied to meet training objectives but spacing should be: a. 1.65 m minimum from the inside edge of the bullet catcher to the flank target centres. b. 0.600 m minimum between target centres lane to lane. c""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 8.pdf, page 1: ""The 25 Metre Barrack Range JSP 403 Volume 2 Edition 3 Change 6 CHAPTER 8 THE 25 METRE BARRACK RANGE INTRODUCTION 0801. General. The 25 metre Barrack Range is the current MOD standard 25m NDA range design. The range, which has a flat range floor, should not be confused with the 1908 designed 30 yard Barrack Range which has been metricated. The 1908 design has limitations which do not apply to this range. This range may be distinguished by it’s cantilevered back wall. 0802. Aim. This chapter sets out the design criteria and construction requirements of this barrack range. In particular it covers: a. Introduction 0801 - 0804 b. Design 0805 - 0809 c.

Compliance Checks 0831 0803. Description. The standard range has six lanes on a flat range floor with a constructed firing point at 25 m and further firing positions at 20, 15 and 10 m. Where required it is possible to provide more than 6 lanes on a range although this will increase cost due to the greater span of the front wall over the bullet trap. 0804. Purpose. The barrack range provides a local facility for limited firing practices up to 25 m. The range is suitable for carrying out the authorised pistol practices, introduction to shooting, remedial training, preliminary""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 9.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 403 Volume 2 The 25 Metre Barrack Range Edition 3 Change 6 d. Target centre height on this range is fixed at 875mm (C). Note: Other layouts may be adopted for pistol practices but sub-  paragraph a. above remains the minimum. RANGE FLOOR 0917. Ricochet Pit. The excavation of a 1.8 m ricochet pit allowed the height of the stop butt wall to be reduced. This was justified by the effect which the pit has in: a. Reducing the number of ricochets from ground strike. b. Reducing the angle of strike and thus lowering the angle of ricochet. c. Moving the point of strike further down-range to help ricochet containment. 0918. Configuration. The range floor is surfaced with a minimum of 150 mm of soil free from large stones (> 30 mm in any dimension). It has to be firm, free draining and should be bound with grass or similar ground cover which is kept cut short. Any paths constructed are to be of non ricochet inducing material. 0919. Side Walls and Banks. The range was designed to safely contain all acceptable aimer deviation and ricochet. It therefore follows that, with proper range discipline and preparatory training, no hazard is predicted beyond the range floor. However, if it is necessary to increase the confidence of people adjacent to the range, a solid or screen wall may be provided. Earth banks may be used to screen a range provided the toe of the bank is beyond the range floor; otherwise a round striking its sloped surface may leave the range. 0920. Fences and Signs. All access to the range when in use must be controlled. Ranges that are in open access areas, particularly those where woods or shrubs come close to the stop butt or side of the range should be fenced and signed to ensure access during firing is controlled. The same measures will be necessary where ranges with sloping earth bunds protect the sides of the range. Local risk assessments will identify areas where access will need to be controlled. Where fences are deemed to be necessary prohibition signs will also be required. A flag pole for a red range in use flag is provided where it can best be seen. If night firing is to be conducted, a red light is fitted to the flag pole. If the flag pole is on the stop butt wall, it is to be made of non-ricochet inducing material. FIRING POINTS 0921. 25 m Firing Points. The 25 m firing point is raised to 450 mm above ground level at the target line so as to ensure a depressed LofS from the prone position. It should also have a low maintenance surface that encourages the firer to take up a comfortable fire position. 0922. Other Firing Points. The 20, 15 and 10 m firing points are for firing weapons from the standing and kneeling positions only. These firing points are not normally specially surfaced.""

Harmonisation Screens cannot be used on this range. DESIGN 0805. General. The range is intended for use in or close to barracks or garrison areas. An increased safety factor has been achieved by moving the top of the stop butt wall forward to over the targets, which increases the angle from the firing points to the top of the wall, and by providing 11 m return wing walls either side of the bullet catcher. Consideration should be given to providing access to the stop butt for maintenance purposes (see para.0823). The range design is based on correctly aimed shots going into the bullet catcher, and also on capturing all shots fired with acceptable and some of the unacceptable aimer deviations. The range layouts are shown in outline at Figures 8-1 and 8-2. 0806. Siting. The range requires a flat and level site on firm, well drained land. It should be orientated so that firing is in a northerly direction to avoid direct sunlight affecting firers\' vision. Although the range has no DA, consideration should be given to activities and to the population density in the area around the site, particularly down-range and on the flanks. 0807. SA Limitations. Limitations on the maximum number of SA, ammunition and rates of fire that can be used on this range are given in Reference B (Pamphlet 21). These limitations give either an increased safety factor under difficult conditions or acknowledge that the design only caters for some practices, and for stable aimed firing. 0808. Shot Guns. The range design is suitable for shot guns firing solid slug or buck shot. Where ranges have significant solid slug practices deleading frequency may need to be increased to avoid the build up of lead at the MPI. 0809. Noise. Siting a barrack range as far as possible from centres of population is the best way of avoiding noise nuisance. No barrack range should be sited closer than 50 m to occupied buildings unless special precautions have been taken to insulate the building against noise. A barrack range firing high velocity weapons should not be within 1 km of sensitive buildings such as hospitals. CONSTRUCTION GENERAL 0810. No Danger Area Range. A NDA range is constructed so that all correctly aimed shot will be captured within the range and that it provides a safe environment for its users. The scale of the structures required represent a higher cost than that of a larger open range with a DA. 0811. Dimensions. A standard 6 lane range is approximately 32 m wide and 45 m long. Ancillary building and earth bunds may increase the plan area required. TARGET AREA 0812. Stop Butt Wall. The wall is normally constructed in reinforced concrete, cast in situ. Concrete on the front canopy wall which might be struck must be clad with 50 mm thick timber on 50 mm timber battens (for fixing refer""  ', '']"

In addition, they may appoint an Environmental Protection Officer (EPO) or Safety, Health Environment and Fire (SHEF) Advisor to advise on management procedures and report back on the effectiveness of measures. If a pollution incident occurs or there is a breach of consent, the commanding officer could be held liable under criminal and/or civil law if it is deemed that they have acted negligently in carrying out their duties (JSP 418 Leaflet 2, page 1, paragraphs 17-19)","['This passage is from JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 284: ""7.

The aim of this chapter is to provide information and guidance on the principles for sound pollution prevention and planning. It also outlines the responsibilities of a unit Pollution Control Officer in the event of a pollution incident. General 2. No one plans to pollute. Most MOD sites have the potential to cause significant environmental harm and to threaten water supplies and public health. This publication, when read in conjunction with JSP 418, provides guidance on how to minimise the risk of an incident occurring. However, there will always be a residual risk of a spillage or fire that could cause significant environmental problems. In addition to the obvious threat posed by chemicals and oils, even materials that are non-hazardous to humans, such as food and beverages, can cause serious environmental harm. The run-off generated in the event of a fire can also be very damaging. 3. The environmental impact of such an incident may be long term and, in the case of groundwater, may persist for decades or even longer. As a result, the legal consequences and clean-up operations can be costly. Rivers, sewers, culverts, drains, water distribution systems and service ducts all present routes for pollutants to travel off- site. As a result, the effects of a discharge may not be evident on site but may become apparent some distance away. 4. In most cases, an incident need not result in serious environmental damage, providing appropriate pollution prevention measures are in place. The key to this is to have a fully useable and understood site drainage plan and carryout Pollution Control Planning supported by a Unit Risk Assessment, see Part 2 Vol 4 Chap 2, from which a Unit Spillage Response Plan (USRP) can be developed, see Part 2 Vol 4 Chap 5 Authority 5. To ensure that the results of the planning process are formally recognised and authorised for application across the unit, it is essential that the requirements of this Part of the JSP 317 be recognised at all levels from Unit Commander/Head of Establishment down. This recognition can be gained through the unit Environmental Action Group (EAG) which is described in JSP 418, Chaired by the Unit Commander/Head of Establishment or his delegated representative. The management of a pollution prevention strategy through the EAG and the appointment of Pollution Control Officer (PCO FLAPs) at each unit provides a focal point for the identification of risks and the preparation of pollution control plans. The key to effective pollution prevention is to ensure that staff are aware of the risks and of the potential consequence of failure to comply with the policy and procedures.""

The Naval Base Commander (QHM) is responsible for the clearance of unattributable pollution and for overseeing or assuming control of the direction of counter pollution operations where they are beyond the control of the polluter. 26. Naval Base Commanders (QHM) have the further duty of initiating deterrent measures within waters under their control. This involves ensuring that all MOD vessels and vessels under MOD charter understand the requirement to report “off ship” pollution incidents promptly, and that all incidents are properly investigated to establish the cause. Relationship between Shoreline MOD Establishments and QHM / Harbour Masters 27. UK & NI based MOD shoreline Units / Establishments are to identify whether their activities fall into any of the caveats of Part 1 Chap 9. If so; then MOD units and establishments that are situated on the shoreline must comply with Part 1 Chap 9 Para 37. In order to comply with Part 1 Chap Para 38, Operating Authorities must produce a USRP that includes both land and marine activities that occur on their sites. (Part 2 Vol 4 Chap’s 1, 2 & 4 refer)). The USRP must also consider neighbouring sites activities; pollution, particularly marine pollution; as it has no respect for administrative boundaries. 28. UK & NI based MOD shoreline Units / Establishments must also consider the need for appropriate accredited Tier 1 maritime spill response training. Training requirement requests must be forwarded to the respective TLB CESO organisation. The CESOs will then coordinate the training requirements and liaise with OC EP STS Halton for availability on the new accredited Tier 1 maritime spill response course. 29. The Naval Base QHM or civilian Harbour Master must be aware of any potential risks that could occur on shoreline MOD establishments; therefore these sites must ensure a formal mechanism is in place with the respective QHM / Harbour Master to identify pollution risks and spill response activities. Sites must forward their USRP to the QHM /Harbour Master, and also receive the QHM / Harbour Master “Port Plan” and ensure that the USRP dovetails into the “Port Plan”. For marine spills, the QHM / Harbour Master “Port Plan” takes primacy over the USRP. The extent of formal cooperation between MOD Shoreline establishments and Naval Base QHM / civilian Harbour Master should include joint training and exercising of likely scenarios that have been identified from the pollution risk assessment. It is important to understand that while all UK & NI based MOD shoreline Units / Establishments have access to a fully accredited Tier 2 EPRS Contractor (Part 2, Vol 4 Chap 6), the QHM / Harbour Master may call on his own Tier 2 Contractor if the need arises. In this case, the polluter pays principle still applies and MOD sites will be responsible for paying the charges for the services provided by the QHM / Harbour Master Tier 2 Contractor. 30""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 418 Leaflet 2.pdf, page 1: ""MOD Corporate Environmental JSP 418 Protection Manual Leaflet 2 • Ensure that where required Environmental Permits/authorisations/licences are obtained and that the conditions are complied with. • Ensure that where required personnel are appropriately trained and competent and full aware of their specific role and responsibility. • Where significant pollution risks have been identified appoint an Environmental Protection Officer (EPO) and/or Safety, Health Environment and Fire (SHEF) Advisor to advise on management procedures and report back on effectiveness of the measures. 17.

However, those sections that remain extant are: • s.60 gives local authorities wide powers in the control of noise from building sites, defining construction widely to include demolition and other engineering operations associated with construction. • s.61 a builder can apply to a local authority prior to commencing construction for consent for noise creation, normally at the same time as application for a building warrant is made, and the authority must grant such a consent if it does not anticipate a noise nuisance will be created. • s.62 deals with noise in built up areas and the noise from loudspeakers in the streets. This Act also introduced the concept of the Noise Abatement Zone (NAZ) which provides a more sophisticated means of controlling, and, where justified, reducing noise from commercial and industrial premises, particularly in areas of mixed development. Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA 1990) Under s79 of the EPA 1990, there is a duty on every local authority to inspect its area at appropriate intervals to detect any statutory nuisances that ought to be dealt with. Where a member of the public makes a complaint of a statutory nuisance to the local authority, the authority has to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to investigate the nuisance. If the Environmental Health Officer assesses that a statutory nuisance exists or is likely to occur, the local authority is duty bound to serve an abatement notice. Such a notice can: • require you to abate the nuisance (i.e. to lessen or reduce the nuisance) • prohibit or restrict the nuisance • require you to carry out works or other steps to abate, restrict or remove the nuisance Enforcement may not always come through the regulatory bodies. Members of the public can also take legal action against the MOD under the same section of the Act. An abatement notice is served under s80 and failing to comply with the terms and conditions of the notice is an offence, non-compliance could expose you and/or your CO/HoE to the risk of prosecution. If a unit or establishment believes that an abatement notice has been incorrectly or improperly served, the unit can appeal. Information on appeal procedures should accompany the notice.""

75,Which UK legislation applies to hazardous substances and restricted materials?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 418 Leaflet 5.odt, several UK legislations apply to hazardous substances and restricted materials. These include but are not limited to:

* The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulation (COSHH) SI 2002/2677
* The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) SI 2002/2776
* The Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP), EC 1272/2008
* Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations SI 2009/1348

These regulations define hazardous substances in various ways, such as a substance that is classified in Table 3.2 of Part 3 of Annex VI of the CLP Regulation for which an indication of danger is very toxic, toxic, harmful, corrosive or irritant, or a substance or mixture fulfilling the criteria relating to physical hazards, health hazards, or environmental hazards laid down in Parts 2 to 5 of Annex I. A dangerous substance is defined as a substance or mixture which meets the criteria for classification as hazardous within any physical hazard class laid down in the CLP Regulation. Restricted materials are those that have any legislative control on their importing, manufacturing, use, or placing on the market.

The aim of this leaflet is to define the requirements for through life management of hazardous substances and restricted materials in compliance with legislation and MOD policy.    2. \tThis leaflet applies to all personnel who manage procurement or use of hazardous substances or material containing hazardous substances. Shortfalls in management can result in unreliable and poor performing equipment, early obsolescence, unnecessary harm to people and the environment. Failure to comply with MOD policy can also leave staff liable to personal civil litigation or crown prosecution.   Hazardous Substance. The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulation 2002, SI (Statutory Instrument) 2002/2677, identifies that a substance hazardous to health means, a substance (including a mixture) which:   Meets the criteria for classification as hazardous within any health hazard class laid down in the Classification Labelling and Packaging Regulation (EC 1272/2008), whether or not the substance is classified under that regulation;   Has a Health and Safety Executive approved workplace exposure limit;   Is a biological agent;   Is dust of any kind, except dust which is a substance within paragraph (a) or (b) above, when present at a concentration in air equal to or greater than;   10 mg/m3, as a time-weighted average over an 8-hour period, of inhalable dust, or;   4 mg/m3, as a time-weighted average over an 8-hour period, of respirable dust;   Is not being a substance falling within sub-paragraphs (a) to (d), because of its chemical or toxicological properties and the way it is used or is present at the workplace creates a risk to health.   Other legislation1 Other legislation will apply similar definitions, ie Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations SI 2009/1348.

Subject to MOD Regulatory processes for exemption authorisation or approval; where restrictions exist, restricted materials should not be used outside those restrictions. Restricted materials should only be used where no suitable alternative exists. Where no alternatives exist and the use is compliant with the restriction, their use should be justified by a MOD Technical Dossier signed at an appropriate management level, eg duty holder, or Acquisition Team Leader. Where there are appropriate Regulatory processes or the use of the restricted material is not compliant with the legislation, the exemption will require a higher level of authorisation, eg Regulator, SofS or other Ministerial approval.   Safety Data Sheets. A major part of the MOD Technical Dossier is the assurance of control measures to prevent harm to people and the environment. Under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, article 6(1a) states.   It shall be the duty of any person who designs, manufactures, imports or supplies any article to take such steps as are necessary to secure that persons supplied by that person with the article are provided with adequate information about the use for which the article is designed or has been tested and about any conditions necessary to ensure that it will be safe and without risks to health at all times when it is being used for.   Hazardous Stores Information System. The delivery of a material safety data sheet (SDS) is an important hazardous substance management enabler that should be managed through the Hazardous Stores Information System (HSIS). In addition to a repository for SDSs, HSIS provides guidance on the provision of safety information for physico-chemical hazards associated with substances, mixtures and articles (equipment). It is designed to be used by staff responsible for procurement, supply, handling, storage, transport, disposal and use of hazardous substances, mixtures and articles. HSIS contains the policy and direction on the provision of safety information applicable to hazardous items held in the defence inventory and guidance on the processes involved and best practice to apply when providing safety information to those involved throughout the supply chain. The following figure outlines a process for management of a SDS.

It defines hazard as ""hazard"" means the physico-chemical or chemical property of a dangerous substance which has the potential to give rise to a fire, explosion or other events which can result in harmful physical effects of a kind similar to those which can be caused by fire or explosion or be corrosive to metals.   Restricted Material. For the purpose of this leaflet, a restricted material is one that has any legislative control on the importing, manufacture, use or placing on the market of the material. In some cases, the material can continue to be used for specific uses or where the substance is below a certain concentration in a mixture or article.   Impact. Hazardous Substances and Restricted Materials have a detrimental effect on the environment, and human health. Many are natural, but more recently the number of man-made substances being manufactured has risen significantly. The scale of impact depends on the type and quantity of material being used and whether the impact is direct or indirect. Concentrations can ultimately reach levels where the health effects cannot be reversed nor damage to the environment remediated.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 418 Leaflet 5.odt, page 0: ""A ""regulation"" is a binding legislative act. It must be applied in its entirety across the EU. A ""directive"" is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to decide how.      Annex A to this document covers some of the key environmental legislation affecting substances and particularly refers to those relating to hazardous substances. Early changes in Treaties and Conventions may be an indicator that legislation is to change. Staff responsible for acquisition should ensure that processes are in place to capture and monitor legislation relevant to their PSS and to identify substances used in its delivery. This should be achieved through engagement with relevant suppliers and manufacturers and use of appropriate contracting conditions.   Manufacturers and importers placing products and substances on the EU market have an obligation to comply with EU legislation and supply sufficient information to allow safe use. Shortfalls in management of compliance can lead to military capabilities being unsafe, ineffective or unsustainable due to reduced reliability, performance or availability of essential materials. In many cases, staff responsible for acquisition of Defence material will be responsible for importing PSS and hence responsible for the compliance with EU/UK regulation.   Whilst the management of hazardous substances are driven by environmental legislation, there are significant issues that can indirectly impact PSS safety. Changes to formulations in mixtures or the availability of substances can result in reduced performance or reliability of equipment or make them unsustainable. Small manufacturers, importers and downstream users may discontinue manufacturing processes or delivery of products due to cost of compliance that could result in redesign of PSS. Hazard logs should reflect risk of harm to users and controls for their management.   Defence Health, Safety and Environmental Protection. In accordance with the Secretary of States’ Health, Safety and Environmental Protection (HS&EP) Policy Statement, Defence Safety Regulatory Publications (DSRPs) directs that, within the UK, Defence is to comply with all applicable legislation (which includes legislation giving effect to the UK’s international obligations). Overseas, and notwithstanding state immunity under customary international law, Defence is to apply UK standards where reasonably practicable and, in addition, is to respond to host nations’ relevant HS&EP expectations and co-operate with host nations’ HS&EP authorities.""

76,Which organisations regulate the MOD's environmental protection obligations?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 418 Part 1.pdf (page 15), there are four main statutory regulators for environmental protection in the UK that regulate the MOD's environmental protection obligations: the Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Natural Resources Wales, and Northern Ireland Environment Agency. Additionally, other organizations have statutory roles for environmental protection, including Local Authorities, Marine Management Organization, Health & Safety Executive (UK Competent Authority for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization & Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation), and Office of the Nuclear Regulator (ONR) (JSP 418 Part 1.pdf, page 15)","['This passage is from JSP 418 Part 1.pdf, page 15: ""5 Regulatory Organisations Statutory Regulators 1.

Northern Ireland Environment Agency 2. Further to the four main statutory regulators other organisations also have statutory roles for EP these include: a. Local Authorities b. Marine Management Organisation c. Health & Safety Executive (UK Competent Authority for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation & Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation) d. Office of the Nuclear Regulator (ONR) 3. The regimes operated by the statutory regulators are dependent on the legislation that empowers them, and there is variety in those. The Environment Act (1995) established the Environment Agency (EA) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) as regulatory bodies for environmental protection; the Natural Resources Body for Wales (Establishment) Order 2012 established Natural Resources Wales as the environmental protection regulator for Wales. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency was launched in 2008 and is an Executive Agency within the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland. 4. Co-ordinated by Director DSEA the Department maintains Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the EA and the MMO while the Department also has a Radioactive Substances Agreement with SEPA. 5. These agreements help standardise interactions between the statutory regulators and Commanding Officers / Heads of Establishment and the Department as a whole; in certain areas the MoU provides interpretation of the regulators responsibilities in Defence. Defence Regulators 6. Defence regulators provide regulations and guidance of environmental protection for defence activities where there is a Departmental responsibility; this includes where these activities take place outside the UK but with due regard to host nation expectations. See JSP 815 Chapter 4 for further details on Defence regulators. 7.

Environmental legislation provides the cornerstone for protecting both the environment and human health from harm. Within the UK, Defence is required to comply with all applicable environmental protection legislation (including legislation giving effect to the UK’s international obligations). Overseas, Defence will apply UK standards where reasonably practicable and, in addition, respond to host nations’ relevant environmental protection expectations. 2. There are a number of pieces of environmental protection legislation, international treaties or protocols which include exemptions (coverage excludes) or derogations (authority given to deviate) relevant to defence activities. Additionally, where legislation does apply, there maybe powers of specific dis-application granted to SofS which may be invoked in the interests of Defence and or national security. In these circumstances the Policy Statement requires the introduction of Departmental arrangements that produces outcomes which are, so far as reasonably practicable, at least as good as those required by legislation. In the few cases where applicable the guidance in Part 2 of this JSP outlines in detail the mandated processes through which an exemption, derogation or dis-application can be granted or utilised for certain defence activities. 3. Under customary international law, Visiting Forces have state immunity from domestic legislation and this is outlined in more detail JSP 815 Part 2. Interface arrangements have been agreed between the Environment Agency and United States Visiting forces (USVF) 3; these form an annex to the Ministry of Defence / Environment Agency Memorandum of Understanding. Legislation 4. There is a wide range of environmental legislation covering air, water, land, waste, natural resources, flora, fauna and human activity which have the potential to impact on Defence. Such requirements can often be complex both individually and collectively and because of the unique position of Defence and the need to maintain outputs including Operational Capability. Defence’s environmental protection obligations can be found throughout differing levels of legislation. Comprehensive lists of relevant environmental protection legislation are required as part of the Environmental Management System (EMS) covering the site; further information on EMS can be found in Chapter 4. International Treaties 5. International treaties are usually signed by national governments (Westminster Parliament not Devolved Administrations) and they may or may not be binding legal requirements on signatories. As Defence operates across national boundaries we need to be aware of our international obligations and these include, amongst others, the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and Their Disposal and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants""  ', '']"

Only matters raised within your Stage 1 complaint will be considered at Stage 2. If the complaint is still not resolved after Stage 2, you may submit a request for a review by the Accommodation Complaints Review Panel (ACRP) at Stage 3 if you believe that accommodation policy has been misinterpreted or misapplied at Stages 1 or 2 of the complaints process.

The circumstances will be investigated, and the contractor will then seek to resolve the complaint. It is expected that the majority of complaints should be satisfactorily resolved at Stage 1. Stage 2 – Escalation of Complaint to DIO Customer Services Team 5. Only when the Stage 1 process has been completed and the case closed, can a Stage 2 complaint be submitted to DIO Accommodation. Only matters raised within your Stage 1 complaint, or directly related to the handling of the complaint, will be considered at Stage 2. Any additional matters should be submitted as a separate Stage 1 Complaint. The DIO will conduct an appropriate investigation and then seek to resolve the complaint. If required, advice and information should be sought from independent experts. 6.

In such cases you are to be formally notified in writing of this decision with a clear explanation of why the complaint is being returned to Stage 1. If the complaint is still not resolved, then you can resubmit the complaint to Stage 2.

2. You are entitled to occupy SSFA or SSLA by virtue of your appointment.
3. You are legally separated from your spouse/civil partner who continues to live in the property purchased (or extended) using a FHTB advance and would be entitled to SSFA because they are designated PStatCat 2.
4. If the assignment during which you receive the FHTB payment is overseas or in Northern Ireland, you can choose to maintain your entitlement to SSFA/SSLA and delay the occupancy requirements of FHTB until your next permanent assignment in the UK, or fulfill the occupancy requirements of FHTB alongside the impact this has on your entitlement to Service accommodation.

82,What are the assessment critera for grading SFA for the purpose of calculating charges?,"The assessment criteria for grading SFA for the purpose of calculating charges are based on the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) 'Decent Homes Standard' (DHS). The properties are placed into one of three categories: Decent Homes Plus (DH+), Decent Homes (DH), and Decent Homes Minus (DH-). The target standard for SFA is DH+. A Decent Home requires the property to meet all the following four criteria: a) it meets the statutory minimum standard for housing, b) it is in a reasonable state of repair, c) it has reasonably modern facilities and services, d) it has a reasonable degree of thermal comfort (assessed using the Government’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for measuring energy efficiency at the following thresholds: DH+ SAP 55 and above, DH SAP 54 to 39, DH- SAP 38 and below). Based on this assessment, a rental discount will be applied to properties by adjusting them to a reduced Condition category, with the starting level set at Decent Homes Plus (DH+) (no discount), and the lowest rent level capped at the Decent Homes Minus (DH-) category.

Some aspects of the factors have been amended to reflect differences overseas, as listed below under ‘Condition’ and ‘Location’. Condition 0507. Condition assessment for SFA is based on the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) ‘Decent Homes Standard’ (DHS). The three categories into which each property will be placed are: Decent Homes Plus (DH+), Decent Homes (DH), and Decent Homes Minus (DH-). The Target standard for SFA is DH+. A Decent Home is determined by the national standard and requires SFA properties to meet all the following four criteria: a. Criterion 1: it meets the statutory minimum standard for housing; b. Criterion 2: it is in a reasonable state of repair (assessed from the age and condition of a range of building components including walls, roofs, windows, doors, chimneys, electrics and heating systems); c. Criterion 3: it has reasonably modern facilities and services (assessed according to the age, size and layout/location of the kitchen, bathroom and WC and any common areas for blocks of flats, and to noise insulation); d. Criterion 4: it has a reasonable degree of thermal comfort.

Overseas. The following conditions apply: a. In-country location assessment. The relative levels of disadvantage (i.e. levels of broadband access, reality of public transport frequency, quality of amenities, level of deprivation) differ between countries. These differences will be given due weighting in considering the Location assessment (Urban, Intermediate or Remote) for each overseas location. Each overseas command has conducted its own assessment, based on in-country knowledge and experience, which has then been ratified by the single Service, UK STRATCOM, DIO and MOD members of the CAAS Working Group16. b. Accessibility to Key Services. The thresholds for the average travel times to the eight 8 key services are amended for overseas locations, in recognition of practicalities such as the frequency/reliability of public transport and realistic expectations of what a SP, partner or dependent might be expected to endure. 17The revised overseas thresholds for average travel times to key services are: (1) Urban (less than 10 minutes); or (2) Intermediate (between 10 minutes and 30 minutes); or (3) Remote (more than 30 minutes).

The assessment of condition, scale and location factors (as described in Vol 3, Part 1, Chapter 5 and detailed at Chapters 3-5 below) will produce an assessment at 3 incremental levels for each factor. This leads to 9 different changing bands (A-I). The combination of the three-level assessments made for each factor will determine the accommodation charging band for individual SFA. The methodology for assessing SFA is provided at Annex A and described as follows: a. Starting point. The start of the banding (top charge – band A) is set at Decent Homes Plus (DH+) for condition, upper scale and urban location, with a discount for those properties that do not meet the top standard; b. Condition. Reduce by two bands for every drop in category for condition (i.e. if a property is in ‘DH’ rather than ‘DH+’ it will drop from band ‘A’ to band ‘C’); c. Scale. Reduce by one band for every drop in category for scale (i.e. if a property is ‘Middle’ rather than ‘Upper’ it will drop from band ‘A’ to band ‘B’); d. Location. Reduce by one band for every drop in category within location (i.e. if a property is ‘Intermediate’ rather than ‘Urban’ it will drop from band ‘A’ to band ‘B’); e. Combination of Condition, Scale or Location reductions. Where a combination of these factors apply, e.g. using all the examples above, if the property is ‘DH’, ‘Middle’ and ‘Intermediate’ it will drop 2+1+1 = 4 Bands, i.e. from Band ‘A’ to Band ‘E’ in accordance with the Table below: 0102.

Furniture Charges for Enhanced Scaling. Where occupants are required to undertake official entertainment or representational hosting and an enhanced furniture scale has been agreed, it is considered reasonable that the cost of this enhancement should be entirely at the Department’s expense. Therefore, enhanced furniture scaling supplied to Senior Officers to meet official entertainment or representational hosting requirements is not to be counted when assessing furniture status. 0614.

SP are charged for F&L via their pay accounts at the F&L UK Norm daily rate. The charges applied are year-round flat rates and are the basis for charges worldwide. The charges are calculated to represent the average cost of supplying energy to a standard property of each SFA Type in the UK. F&L charges are annotated on the pay statement as ‘F&L Overseas’: this same reference is also applied to qualifying SFA in the UK. The rates for F&L are published annually by Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) SD EUS (Energy, Utilities and Sustainability). 0420. Utility Provider Energy Bills. SP occupying privately rented accommodation who are in receipt of Overseas Rent Allowance (ORA), and SP in other Service provided family accommodation overseas who are required to pay energy bills directly to the landlord/utility company are entitled to claim a refund via JPA. They are subject to paying flat rate F&L charges and the associated annual reconciliation process detailed below. 0421. Reconciliation Process. F&L charges are paid from April to March when a meter reading of the actual fuel used is taken. An annual calculation is made to establish the difference between the F&L charges paid against the amount of energy actually used. This generates an amendment figure to be charged, (subject to a maximum laid down by Defence Infrastructure Organisation) or refunded to the occupant. Debits or Credits are applied by using the fuel and light adjustment via JPA. In Germany, the X/Y system also incorporates a gainshare rebate mechanism, which shares any savings arising from energy use of less than the ‘Y-rate’ with SP. 0422. SFA occupied by Virtue of Appointment. DIO is responsible, in accordance with local arrangements, for meeting all utility costs (gas, electricity, heating oil etc.) for SFA which is occupied by an individual by virtue of their appointment who is P Stat Cat 3, 4 or 5 and unaccompanied; these properties are locally administered with energy bills sent to the designated billing unit for payment.

86,How are investment decisions made within the MOD?,"Investment decisions within the MOD are made by responsible managers based on thorough appraisals that provide information on the costs and benefits of available options. These appraisals serve three main purposes: they help the manager make a sound decision, provide a record for approval processes, and serve as a starting point for later reviews or audits. The aim is to achieve Value for Money (VfM) defined as optimizing net social costs and benefits based on economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. VfM can be expressed as the optimal trade-off between time, cost, and effectiveness, considering all significant factors that have not been possible to sensibly value. The process involves setting clear objectives, defining the scope, considering options including in-house alternatives, undertaking a risk assessment, and achieving the best value for money outcome within available funding.

Media staff will consider such requests and recommend whether to proceed, in each case informing the Director of Resources responsible for the management of the assets and/or resources as quickly as possible, and providing their considered evaluation of the expected benefits in Public Relations (PR) terms. Media staff may also identify which MOD assets/resources may be suitable for the programme. DIRECTOR OF RESOURCES FINANCE STAFF Finance staff are responsible to the Director of Resources for the financial management of defence assets and resources, as well as maximising revenue where possible. Upon receipt of a Media and Communication staff recommendation of support to a project and their related evaluation of its Public Relations PR benefits, finance staff should cost the proposal and seek authority from the Director of Resources (or someone to whom that person has delegated such authority) to a price for commercial staff to negotiate with the company.

Where there are any other significant factors to be considered, such as potential alternative suppliers or innovative support packages, an appraisal must be undertaken. Business Improvement Policy 34. The overriding objective is to provide defence outputs offering best value for money affordable to the taxpayer. As part of the process of ensuring a fair comparison can be made between the true costs and risks of undertaking activities commercially and those of retaining activities in-house an investment appraisal must be produced. 35. In reviewing activities, there is a need to: a. set clear objectives; b. ensure that the scope is fully defined and robust; c. consider the full range of options to meet the requirement including in-house options; d. undertake a fully detailed risk assessment; e. achieve the best value for money outcome within available funding. 36. The scoping and feasibility stages of each review will determine the eventual means of securing improvement. In determining the appropriate scope, consideration should be given to the potential impact on MOD employees inside and outside the project boundary. Whatever the eventual outcome, the review process is likely to result in new ways of delivering services and TUs will need to be involved. Management must keep the TUs fully informed and consult with them as appropriate and at the appropriate level. The process must be as transparent as possible recognising commercial sensitivities, to ensure that Trade Unions and staff understand how an objective decision will be reached. It should be borne in mind that MOD policy for interaction with TU’s is clearly set out in the Employee Relations Policy located in the People Services pages of the Defence Intranet and any failure to adhere to its direction is likely to delay, rather than expedite the project. 37. TLBs or Trading Funds considering proposals for the external provision of services will need to address the full resource implications of such projects. Potential projects must be given proper priority and be effectively managed. If the potential benefits from commercialisation appear to be relatively small, and are likely to be outweighed by the costs of competition or the increased MOD management costs, the work should be retained in-house. 38. Management must approach consultation with an open mind and seek to achieve agreement by creating a relationship with the Trade Unions based on mutual trust through openness, explanation and the exchange of views.

If decisions can be shown to be based on sound and thorough appraisals, and are properly evaluated, then the position of the Accounting Officer is protected. The Purpose of Appraisal 5. An investment appraisal serves three main purposes. a. Its prime function is to give the responsible manager the information he or she needs to make a sound decision. As such, appraisal is an essential part of the search for best value for money. b. When a decision is outside the manager’s delegated authority, then an appraisal will need to be presented as part of a submission for approval, and will form an important part of the case for gaining approval. A thorough appraisal that is well documented and presented will help to demonstrate that the project is soundly based and will smooth the process of gaining approval. c. The appraisal also provides a record of what was expected to be achieved by the project and the factors on which the decision was based. It will be an important starting point for any later review or audit of the project, and in particular for project evaluation. 6. The aim is not to reduce decision taking to mere mechanics, but rather to place it on a rational and informed basis in which decisions are taken with a clear understanding of the costs and benefits of the available options. Value for Money 7. In pursuing policy objectives, the objective of all public sector bodies is to achieve Value for Money (VfM) defined as optimising net social costs and benefits. The assessment of value is based upon the interests of society as a whole rather than to MOD or the public sector alone (see Part 2, Chapter 5, paragraph 27). VfM can be defined as the optimal combination of: a. Economy – i.e. Cost of Inputs (I/M : Inputs/Money) b. Efficiency – i.e. Ratio of Output to Inputs (O/I : Outputs/Inputs c. Effectiveness – i.e. Value of Outcomes from Outputs (V/O : Value/Outputs) Hence VfM = I/M x O/I x V/O = V/M (Value / Money) 8. VfM can also be expressed as the optimal trade-off between time, cost and effectiveness. This does not necessarily mean choosing the lowest cost bid, nor highest performance regardless of the consequences. VfM is derived using the methodology set out in this Guide to provide a through life cost expressed in Net Present Value (NPV) terms considered alongside other significant factors that have not been possible to sensibly value (see Part 2, Chapter 5). 9. VfM is a relative concept which involves the comparison of potential and actual outcomes of alternative procurement options. VfM is only meaningful where options exist.""  ', '']"
87,How do I manage the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates?,"To manage the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates in a project, follow these steps as outlined in JSP 507 Part 2.pdf (page 110):

1. Perform a ""sanity check"" by comparing the optimism bias adjusted cost with the existing calculation of confidence figures using a bottom-up approach.
2. If the optimism bias adjusted figure is close to the mean cost estimate, no further investigation is required.
3. If the optimism bias adjusted figure is close to or exceeds the 90% cost estimate, review the 90% cost estimate as insufficient consideration may have been given to an aspect of risk.
4. The comparison of the optimisim bias adjusted figure to the 90% cost estimate should not be viewed as a pass or fail test.

Additionally, refer to JSP 507 Part 2.pdf (page 107) for calculating upper bound values for combined projects and applying optimism bias adjustments.

The resulting figure should equate to the expected value or “mean” cost estimate. If the optimism bias adjusted cost is close to the “mean” cost estimate, no further investigation is required. 26. If the optimism bias adjusted figure is close to, or exceeds, the 90% cost estimate, this should not be ignored. The 90% cost estimate should be reviewed, as the implication of the “sanity check” is that insufficient consideration has been given to an aspect of risk. Example The confidence estimates of capital expenditure for a standard buildings project are as follows: 10% £130M 50% £146M 90% £158M The most likely estimate of cost is £145M. The mitigated optimism bias percentage to be applied to the capital expenditure has been estimated as 3.9%. The forecast capital expenditure for this example, taking into account optimism bias, is £151M, which is calculated as follows: £145M + (3.9% x £145M) = £151M 1 0 % £ 1 3 0 M £ 1 5 8 M C O S T  5 0 9 0 £ 1 4 6 M M o s t lik e ly e stim a te a n d O B = £ 1 5 1 M £ 1 5 1 M  3 .9 % £ 1 4 5 M 27. However, it does not mean that the 90% estimate is necessarily wrong. As long as both the original risk assessment and the optimism bias adjustment have been reviewed, and the outcome documented, the comparison of the optimism bias adjusted figure to the 90% cost estimate should not be viewed as a pass or fail test. It is not always sensible or required for the 90% cost estimate to exceed the more crudely estimated optimism bias adjusted cost.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 107: ""13. To calculate the appropriate upper bound values for combined projects the following approach is recommended: a. Determine the percentage split for each identified project type (use best judgment). b. Identify the upper bound values for each project type. c. Multiply each percentage of capital expenditure by the appropriate upper bound optimism bias. d. Add the optimism bias contributions together to determine the resultant optimism bias percentage. 14. The following table shows a worked example of the calculated resultant upper bound optimism bias level for capital expenditure for a combined building project: Project Type Percentage of CAPEX (%) Upper bound OB (%) OB Contribution (%) Resultant OB (%) Non-standard building 30 51 15.3 (30 x 51.4) - Standard building 70 24 16.8 (70 x 24) - Combined building 100 - - 32.1 (15.3 + 16.8) 15. As optimism bias factors have only been established for capital costs and works duration, the estimation of optimism bias will not be readily applicable for all projects. 16. Optimism bias should only be applied to new expenditure, rather than to opportunity costs of existing assets. 17. The ‘outsourcing’ category should only be used for options concerned with provision of services by the private sector, such as hard and soft facilities management services, and activities such as equipment maintenance, support, and overhauls. 18. In some circumstances, such as an ongoing in-house service contract, or for MOD training exercises, where there are no capital costs involved, adjustments for optimism bias are not appropriate. Sensitivity analysis should be used in such cases to test the potential impact of optimism on key parameters. Step Two – Always start with the upper bound 19. Use the appropriate upper bound value for optimism bias from Table 1 above as the starting value for calculating the optimism bias level. These upper bound values must always be used, unless robust evidence exists to use a different value. Step Three – Consider whether the optimism bias factor can be reduced 20.

Adjusting for optimism bias should be viewed as a process, rather than an event. Optimism bias should be assessed at each key stage in a project’s approval process. For medium and larger projects, this would require assessments at the Concept Phase, and prior to Initial Gate and Main Gate approval. Estimating optimism bias 8. There are four steps to follow in the evaluation of optimism bias, as follows: Step one Determine appropriate project type(s) Step two Start with upper bound estimate Step three Reduce each optimism bias factor according to degree of mitigation Step four Multiply cost estimate by overall risk mitigated optimism bias factor Step One – Determine appropriate project type 9. Each option within a project must be reviewed to determine the appropriate project type or types. Careful consideration needs to be given to the characteristics of each option within a project to determine the project type from the list at Table 1. The definitions of the project types are as follows: a.

You should also receive the same notice and opportunities as other employees prior to organisational change, even during mobilisation (JSP 532.pdf, page 12). Your civilian employment rights are protected, and both you and your employer may be entitled to claim financial assistance (JSP 753 Part 1, page 4). Additionally, if you have mental health concerns related to your deployment, there is a Reserves Mental Health Programme that provides assessment and treatment (JSP 950 Leaflet 2-7-2, JSP 753 Part 2, page 44).

Standing Military Tasks, such as support to the operation of Permanent Joint Operating Bases or maritime components. c. Defence Activity Other Than Operations (DAOTO)9, such as Military Capacity Building, Short Term Training Teams or activities in direct support of defence diplomacy objectives. 12. Restrictions. To retain the support of employers and the ability to mobilise reservists for priority tasks, taking into account that there are limits on the duration of permanent service within set periods, reservists should not routinely be mobilised solely to conduct training, professional / personal development activities, or provide training support which is not directly related to operations. Such activities should be undertaken under Sections 22, 24, 25 or 27 of RFA 96. However, mobilisation for DAOTO may require employment in support of training activity to achieve Defence strategic objectives. It is likely that restrictions would be removed in the event of national emergency or warfighting operations, directed within Sections 52 and 54 of RFA 96 respectively. The Mobilisation Process 13. The generic mobilisation process is shown diagrammatically at Figure 1 and described below10: a. Statement of Requirement. SCs are responsible for force generation within their respective Service and deciding on whether there is a requirement to mobilise reservists for an operation or task. This will normally be established following a review of the operational Statement of Requirement (SOR) or CDS Directive which will detail the capabilities required for any task. b. Call-Out / Recall Order. A call-out order provides legal authority to mobilise reservists. A recall order provides lawful authority to mobilise persons liable to recall. A call-out order is not required to mobilise High Readiness Reserves (HRR) or Sponsored Reserves (SR). The authority to issue a call-out notice can be delegated by the Secretary of State for Defence to the Minister for Armed Forces (Min AF) or the relevant SC. c. Selection of Personnel for Mobilisation. Defence seeks to reduce mobilisation risk11 by applying selection filters before issuing call-out notices. These include the willingness, suitability and availability of a reservist to deploy. This process is known 9 In accordance with the Defence DAOTO Directive (held at OS) and 2019DIN03-017. 10 This process is focussed on enduring, planned and small-medium scale operations. Mobilisation at pace and scale under Section 52 and 56 of RFA 96 would require process efficiencies. 11 For example, through reducing the likelihood of an application for deferral or exemption and of medical  as ‘Intelligent Selection’.

It is the process that underpins call-""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 753 Part 1.pdf, page 4: ""1 General Conditions Introduction 1. Reserve Forces provide an integral component of the UK Defence capability, as part of the Whole Force1. Provision is made with respect to the Reserve Forces by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96), as amended by the Armed Forces Act 2006 (AFA 06) and the Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14). RFA 96 provides for the call-out and recall of Reserve Forces for permanent service. This process is also referred to as ‘mobilisation’ and serves as the primary mechanism for reservists to undertake military operations or other authorised military tasks. 2. For the purposes of this JSP, mobilisation is the process by which an individual reservist, or group of reservists, is brought into permanent service. Failure to attend for service on call-out without leave lawfully granted or a reasonable justification is an offence under RFA 96. However, reservists and employers have the right to apply for deferral of, or exemption from, a reservist’s liability to be mobilised or, in the case of persons already serving, release or discharge from service. RFA 96 limits the periods for which reservists may be required to serve when mobilised. Once brought into permanent service, reservists attract many of the same rights and benefits as their Regular counterparts. In addition, their civilian employment rights are protected and both the employer and reservist may be entitled to claim financial assistance. 3. The Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14) amended RFA 96 to allow the Secretary of State (SofS) for Defence to authorise the mobilisation of Reserve Forces if it appears to the Secretary of State that it is necessary or desirable to use reservists for any purpose for which members of the Regular services may be used2. This amendment significantly broadened the circumstances in which reservists could be mobilised. The intent of DRA 14, as a key component of the Future Reserves 2020 programme, was to enable reservists to be effectively integrated within the Whole Force, making a valuable, flexible and sustainable contribution to Defence capability. The Reserve Forces 4. The UK Reserve Forces consist of: a. Volunteer Reserve Forces. Volunteers who accept an annual training commitment and a liability for call-out for permanent service. The Volunteer Reserve Forces are the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR), the Army Reserve3, and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF). 1 The Whole Force was introduced in the 2011 Defence Reform Review to ensure that Defence is supported by the most sustainable, effective, integrated and affordable balance of Regular military personnel, Reservists, MOD civilians and contractors. 2 The new, broader call-out liability introduced by DRA 14 does not apply automatically to those who joined the Reserve or Regular Forces before 1 October 2014, but such persons may elect to accept that liability""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 753 Part 2.pdf, page 44: ""d. provision of an appropriate medical examination, prior to cessation of permanent service, in accordance with Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985 and Service guidelines. e. review any welfare issues still outstanding and ensure appropriate follow-up action is in place.

Medical (Including CASEVAC) 11. Mobilised reservists are to be treated in the same manner as their regular counterparts. Mobilised reservists are to be identified on NOTICAS in line with the instructions in JSP 751 (Joint Casualty and Compassionate Policy and Procedures) Chapter 2. Welfare 12. Family Support. The provision of welfare support for the families of reservists is fundamental to ensuring that the reservist element of any deployed force is effective. The families of reservists do not expect support over and above that afforded their Regular counterparts but their needs and the methods of meeting these needs do differ. Commanders at all levels need to be aware of and understand these differences. 13. Regular Reserve. The needs of the Regular Reserve differ further from those of the Volunteer Reserve in that regular reservists are likely to come from different parts of the United Kingdom and abroad and thus lack the focus of a unit structure before, during and after permanent service. Again, commanders must be aware of each individual’s circumstances. 14. Mental Health. All reservists are to be briefed fully on stress, the Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) system and the support available to them both during the mobilisation process and again during demobilisation. Further information can be found in JSP 950 Leaflet 2-7-1 (Mental Health and Wellbeing Briefing, Before During and After Deployment). The Reserves Mental Health Programme provides assessment and treatment for reservists who have been deployed overseas since 1 Jan 03 as a reservist and believe their deployment may have affected their mental health. Further information can be found in JSP 950 Leaflet 2-7-2 (Defence Mental Health Services). Post Deployment Reports for Employers - Guidance 15. All mobilised reservists are to receive a post deployment letter aimed at their employers from their Unit Employer Support Officers (UESOs), detailing what they have achieved during their deployment and what qualifications and / or skills they have learned / developed. This formalises best practice by briefing employers, in readily understandable terminology, on the activities of their reservist employee during a period of mobilised service and is in addition to a Serviceperson’s Joint Appraisal Report.

89,What funding can I get for resettlement from the Army after 15 years' service?,"According to JSP 905 Part 1.pdf, if you have at least 12 years of qualifying service in the Regular forces and are not entitled to an EDP or an immediate pension under AFPS 15, you may be entitled to a Resettlement Grant (RG). The amount of the RG is determined by the scheme manager and can be found on the AF Pensions page. You must apply for the grant within 3 months of leaving the Regular forces. If you have previously received a Resettlement Grant or are an active member of AFPS 75 or AFPS 05, you will not be eligible for another Resettlement Grant (JSP 905 Part 1.pdf, paragraphs 149-151).

Additionally, JSP 534 Part 1.odt mentions that the Standard Learning Credit (SLC) Scheme allows personnel to obtain financial assistance for learning costs up to a maximum of £175 per Financial Year. To qualify for SLC funding, the course of study must lead to a nationally recognized qualification and directly benefit the Service (JSP 534 Part 1.odt, page 0).

Therefore, based on the provided reference texts, after 15 years' service in the Army, you may be entitled to a Resettlement Grant if you meet the eligibility criteria and have not previously received one. Additionally, you can apply for financial assistance through the Standard Learning Credit Scheme for further education or training that leads to a nationally recognized qualification.

91,Under what circumstances do I need to gain ethical approval for research conducted within the MOD?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 536 Part 2.pdf on page 6 in Annex 1A, ethical approval is required for research projects that meet all three of the following conditions:

1. The project is funded by the MOD or involves MOD-employed staff or participants.
2. The project is considered research as defined by JSP 536 (i.e., an attempt to derive generalisable or transferable new knowledge with scientifically sound methods and the intention to publish results).
3. Human participants are involved, including those participating as cadets, and data from human participants will be gathered regardless of anonymity or secondary analysis of datasets that include personal data.

Therefore, if a research project falls under these conditions, it is necessary to gain ethical approval through the process outlined in Annex 1C of JSP 536 Part 2.pdf. (Annex 1C: The process for scientific and ethics review)

Checklist for protocols that require review in accordance with JSP 536 The decision as to whether a protocol requires review lies with the Research Sponsor in collaboration with the Chief Investigator. This guide must be read in conjunction with Parts 1 and 2 of JSP 536 (refer to Part 1 Chapter 1 paras 6-14 for full direction on research that is within scope and needs review). Review is required if the answer to ALL three questions below is YES. Question 1 Is your project funded by the MOD, or does it involve MOD-employed staff or participants? Yes / No • Review is required if any researchers or participants are funded (including paid) wholly or in part by the MOD, and the research is relevant to their MOD role or activities. • This includes personnel conducting research as part of a degree or course of study funded by MOD, or taking place during MOD funded work time. • Research involving veterans or military families are generally not included unless: o It is funded by MOD or conducted by MOD funded staff. o Comparisons are to be made to serving personnel. o MOD funded services/sites/property are being analysed, assessed or used. • Cadets, including under 18 cadets, are included if participating as cadets. Question 2 Is your project research? Yes / No • Research is defined as “the attempt to derive generalisable or transferable new knowledge to answer or refine relevant questions with scientifically sound methods”. • Audit and service evaluation (including evaluation of existing training) are not research, and do not require review, unless there are significant (i.e. ethical) issues. It is up to the Research Sponsor and Chief Investigator to determine what a significant ethical issue might be. Please refer to annex 1B for definitions of these other types of activities. • In order to be research there must be the intention to publish the results/outcomes (e.g. as a technical report, briefing note, peer reviewed article etc.) so as to add to knowledge or inform organisational policy/practice. Undergraduate student dissertations, or taught masters dissertations, are generally not considered research in this sense because they are not published and therefore not generalisable or transferable. However, there is the expectation that undergraduate projects/dissertations will receive the appropriate ethics review from the awarding institution. Question 3 Are human participants involved? Yes / No • Will data (quantitative, qualitative or observational) be gathered from human participants (inclusive of all ages, military / civilian status and nationality)? • You must still answer ‘yes’ to this question even if you will use anonymity. • Research using the secondary analysis of datasets that include personal data (medical, employment related, behavioural, psychometric etc.) collected for non-research purposes""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 536 Part 1.pdf, page 13: ""Principle 8: Approval A research project is started only if the research protocol / proposal (and any other relevant information) has received a favourable review of the scientific quality and the ethics. For certain research, additional relevant bodies may also need to approve the protocol. Within MOD, scientific quality is reviewed by a Scientific Assessment Committee (SAC) and ethics review is provided by the MOD Research Ethics Committee (MODREC). Principle 9: Accessible Findings The findings, whether positive or negative, are made accessible, with adequate consent and privacy safeguards, in a timely manner after the study has finished, in compliance with any applicable regulatory standards, i.e. legal requirements or expectations of regulators. The only exceptions are research for educational purposes, early phase trials and security sensitive research. In addition, where appropriate, information about the findings of the research is available to those who took part in it, in a suitable format and timely manner, unless otherwise justified. Principle 10: Choice Research participants2 are afforded respect and autonomy, taking account of their capacity to understand. Where there is a difference between the research and the standard practice that they might otherwise experience, research participants are given information to understand the distinction and make a choice, unless MODREC agrees otherwise. Where participants’ explicit consent is sought, it is voluntary and informed. Where consent is refused or withdrawn, this is done without reprisal.

Principle 12: Respect for Privacy All information collected for or as part of the research project is recorded, handled and stored appropriately and in such a way and for such time that it can be accurately reported, interpreted and verified, while the confidentiality of individual research participants remains appropriately protected. Data and tissue collections are managed in a transparent way that demonstrates commitment to their appropriate use for research and appropriate protection of privacy.

Has an appropriate security classification been applied to the protocol which will, where appropriate, carry over to the research report and the assessment for eventual release of the results? Security classification should reflect the research topic, the research subjects and locations involved and any other partner nations taking part in the research. b. Appropriateness. All MOD sponsored research3 must have an output that has utility to the MOD or other government departments (OGDs). CIs and Research Sponsors must ensure that research is appropriate to the Research Strategies and Priorities of the MOD or OGDs. c. Data Handling. All research data must be handled with respect to current Data Protection Legislation (i.e. DPA 18) and the Caldicott Principles. Where research is being undertaken that would routinely seek consent of the participants, but this cannot be achieved (e.g. retrospective cohort studies) then it will be the responsibility of the CI and Research Sponsor to make an application to the NHS Confidentiality Advisory Group4 to seek a ‘Section 251 approval’5 to conduct research work without consent. Public Participation 9. Where appropriate, patients or research participants (especially members of the Armed Forces) may be included in the design or assessment of feasibility of the research. This may include, but is not restricted to: a. Having participant information, questionnaires and study de-briefs assessed for readability and comprehension within the proposed research participant group or expert patient groups; b. Assessing whether proposed testing can be conducted in the environment or at the frequency proposed without detriment to military training or operations; c. Ensuring that the proposed research subjects are not already involved in multiple other research proposals (research overload). 10. Public participation in research design or conduct is often undertaken for NHS research. However, within the MOD the topics being researched, the security and personal safety of research participants, wider MOD security consideration6 and the potential for adverse public comment on MOD research should be considered before undertaking public consultation for MOD or MOD-sponsored research.

However, it's important to note that gaining research ethics approval also requires confirmation of management permission or approval from relevant organizations to proceed with the research (JSP 536 Part 2.pd, page 51, point 30). Therefore, the overall timeframe for gaining research ethics approval may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each study and the timeliness of securing necessary approvals beyond MODREC's purview.

Research should normally commence within 12 months of the date on which a favourable ethics opinion is given by MODREC. A study is generally considered to have commenced when any of the procedures set out in the protocol are initiated. 2. If the study not commence within 12 months the Chief Investigator (CI) must give MODREC a written explanation for the delay. 3. If the project not commence within 24 months a further explanation must be given and a decision will be taken by the MODREC chair as to whether the project must require re-review before commencing. 4. If a study is abandoned prior to commencement, the CI or Research Sponsor must notify MODREC by letter, giving reasons. It is not necessary to submit the form for declaring the conclusion or early termination of the study. If a study is abandoned and it is later proposed to start it afresh, a new application must be made. Monitoring of research given a favourable opinion 5. Under the Clinical Trials Regulations, the Research Sponsor of a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product has a variety of statutory responsibilities for notifying the relevant REC of developments in the research after it has started. These are outlined in the HRA SOPs, and must be adhered to if MODREC is the relevant REC. 6. For other types of studies MODREC must keep under review the favourable ethics opinion given to any research study in the light of progress reports and significant developments in the research. 7. Other than by means of the reports that the Research Sponsor and investigators are required to submit, MODREC has no responsibility for proactive monitoring of research studies. The accountability for this lies with the Research Sponsor and the employing organisation. 8. The Chief Investigator and representatives of the Research Sponsor may be requested to attend a meeting of MODREC or sub-committee at any time to discuss any ethics or safety concerns about the research.

Confirmation of management permission or approval from relevant organisation(s) to proceed with the research also needs to be in place. The various responsibilities in relation to carrying out the research are described in JSP 536 Part 1 Chapter 3. Duration of a favourable ethics opinion 31. MODRECs favourable ethics opinion for a specific research study applies for the duration of the study, except where action is taken to suspend or terminate the opinion. Extension of the study period represents a substantial amendment. If the research is open ended a review (initially by a MODREC sub-committee) must be conducted every five years. 32. It must be noted that continuation of the ethics opinion only applies to the study as described in the application, the protocol and any amendments made by the Research Sponsor. Further applications must be made for ethics review where required to undertake additional studies.

SAC Review 7. A SAC review is an iterative process, involving discussion between the CI and the SAC. It is not the SACs role to re-write protocols, hypotheses or scientific questions; however, where there are issues with the quality of the science or a study\'s ability to answer the scientific question then the SAC should advise the CI and Research Sponsor that changes need to be made to the protocol to resolve the problems. 8. The SAC will review the protocol and provide feedback to the CI and the Research Sponsor.

SACs review protocols to meet a 20-working day turnaround (10 days for proportionate review, see para 11). Where possible the report should reach the CI / Research Sponsor in time to meet the timeline for submission to the next MODREC meeting. Additional meetings/reviews may be convened, as required, to consider issues arising from new tasking, particularly Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) and/or Urgent Business Requirements (UBRs).

93,How do I treat frostbite during a field exercise?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 539 Part 2.pdf, pages 19 and 20, the following are the recommended therapeutic options for treating frostbite in a field exercise:

1. Rapid field rewarming of frostbite by immersion in warm water (between 37-39°C) if proper equipment is available and definitive care is more than 2 hours away. This should only be done if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until the patient arrives at definitive care.
2. Pain control through pain medications such as NSAIDs or opiate analgesics during rewarming.
3. Spontaneous or passive thawing by moving into a warmer location and warming with adjacent body heat from another person if rapid rewarming is not possible.
4. Debridement of blisters only in the field if a clear, fluid-filled blister is tense and at high risk for rupture during an evacuation, and aspiration of the blister and application of a dry gauze dressing should be performed to minimize infection. Hemorrhagic bullae should not be aspirated or debrided electively in the field.
5. Substantial edema post rewarming should be anticipated, and circumferential dressings should be wrapped loosely to allow for swelling without placing pressure on the underlying tissue.
6. A risk-benefit analysis should consider the potential for further trauma and ambulation on thawed lower extremities.
7. Elevation of the affected extremity if possible.
8. Oxygen delivery by face mask or nasal cannulas if the patient is hypoxic (oxygen saturation SpO2 <90%) or at high altitude (>5000 m).

Additionally, from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex B.pdf, page 6, it is recommended to remove wet clothing and put on dry, warm, and windproof clothing, cover the casualty's head and neck, gently warm them up, provide warm food and drink, huddle with others around the casualty, re-warm hands and feet using available measures (body warmth, clothing, rubbing, hand warmers), and report the situation to military command or defense organization's occurrence-reporting procedures. Do not use any artificial heat, hot water, or stoves as it will make the injury worse.

Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 2 include the following:  a.  Rapid field rewarming of frostbite. Field rewarming by warm water bath immersion can and should be performed if the proper equipment and methods are available and definitive care is more than 2 hours away. Field rewarming should only be undertaken if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until the patient arrives at definitive care. (1)  Water should be heated to between 37-39°C. If a thermometer is not available, a safe water temperature can be determined by placing an uninjured  hand in the water for at least 30 seconds to confirm that the water temperature is tolerable and will not cause burn injury.  (2)  The affected limb should be suspended in circulating water. Because the water may cool after the rewarming process is started, the water should be continually, but carefully, warmed to the target temperature.  (3)  Rewarming is complete when the involved part takes on a red or purple appearance and becomes soft and pliable to the touch. This will take approximately 30 minutes but may take a longer or shorter amount of time depending on the extent and depth of the injury.  (4)  The affected tissues should then be allowed to air dry or gently dried with blotting motions to minimize further damage.  b.  Pain control. During rewarming, pain medications (e.g., NSAIDs or opiate analgesics) should be given to control symptoms as dictated by individual patient response and medication availability. c.  Spontaneous or passive thawing. Rapid rewarming is strongly recommended.  If field rewarming is not possible, however, spontaneous or slow thawing may be unavoidable and should be allowed. Slow rewarming can be accomplished by moving into a warmer location and warming with adjacent body heat from another person. d.  Debridement of blisters. Debridement of blisters should not be routinely performed in the field. If a clear, fluid-filled blister is tense and at high risk for rupture during an evacuation, aspiration of the blister and application of a dry gauze dressing should be performed in the field to minimise infection. Hemorrhagic bullae should not be aspirated or debrided electively in the field.  e.  Dressings. Substantial oedema post re-warming should be anticipated and circumferential dressings should be wrapped loosely to allow for swelling without placing pressure on the underlying tissue.  f.  Ambulation and protection. A risk-benefit analysis should again consider the potential for further trauma and, ultimately, higher morbidity if a thawed part is used for ambulation.  g.  Elevation of extremity. If possible, the thawed extremity should be elevated.  h.  Oxygen. Oxygen (if available) may be delivered by face mask or nasal cannula if the patient is hypoxic (oxygen saturation SpO2 <90%) or the patient is at high altitude (>5000 m).

Avoid ambulation on thawed lower extremity (unless only distal toes are affected)  33.  Photography. Photographs should be taken as soon as possible after injury, soon after thawing, and frequently thereafter to document the disease process. Any photograph is useful, although high-quality clinical photographs are preferred. Photographs should accompany the patient when attending any specialist review. Photographs should be taken and handled in accordance with JSP 950 Part 1 Lft 2-1-3 Defence Medical Services Clinical Photographic Policy.  Cold Sensitivity  34.  Cold sensitivity is a common sequalae even to mild cold injury, both FCI and NFCI. It is often the presenting complaint following a cold injury. Individuals suffering from FCI / NFCI should be protected from further cold exposure for at least 6 weeks, until it is proven they have not been cold sensitised. Non-Freezing Cold Injury (NFCI)3  35.  Background. NFCI continues to be a significant cause of Disease and Non-Battle Injury (DNBI) casualties in personnel operating in cold and/or wet environments. This has implications for mission success and is thus a major component of operational risk analysis.  It also has implications for future employment and deployment. The evidence-base relating to NFCI’s pathophysiology, risk factors, prevention, identification and diagnosis is generally weak, being largely drawn from small laboratory studies on animals and humans, case-based evidence from the field, or expert opinion. The criteria used to reach this conclusion (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network4,5) are not wholly appropriate for some of the areas of evidence associated with NFCI. Thus, the weak or absent evidence surrounding the understanding and clinical approach to NFCI does not necessarily mean what is thought true or undertaken is wrong, but rather that the level of evidence supporting clinical activity in other conditions is lacking for NFCI.  36.""

Anyone with  damaged or contaminated areas of frostbite, e.g., frostbite complicating a gunshot wound,  should be started on antibiotics and have anti-tetanus immediately (using an appropriate  antibiotic protocol) and transferred to hospital for specialist care. When FCI is severe, the risks of anaerobic infection are significant, and gas gangrene and tetanus have killed many of  those with the worst cold injuries in the past.  29.  Spontaneous or passive thawing. Most frostbite will thaw spontaneously and should be allowed to do so if rapid rewarming cannot be readily achieved. Strategies for 2 scenarios are presented:  a.  Scenario 1. The frozen part has the potential of refreezing and will not be actively thawed.  b.  Scenario 2. The frozen part can be kept thawed and warm with minimal risk of refreezing until evacuation is completed.  30.  Therapeutic options for both Scenarios 1 and 2.  a.  Treatment of hypothermia. Hypothermia frequently accompanies frostbite. HTI (hypothermia staging) may be treated concurrently with the frostbite injury. HTII-IV  should be treated effectively before treating the frostbite injury. b.  Hydration. Appropriate hydration is important in frostbite recovery and fluids should be administered if possible. Oral fluids should be given if the patient is alert. If the patient is nauseated, vomiting or has an altered mental status, warmed IV fluids  should be given if available. c.  Ibuprofen. If available, ibuprofen (400-800mg TDS) should be started in the field. 31.  Specific recommendations Scenario 1. Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 1 include the following:  a.  Dressings. Apply if it is practical to do so and will not interfere with mobility. Dressings should be applied to the frozen part and between the toes and fingers.  b.  Ambulation and protection. If at all possible, a frozen extremity should not be used for walking, climbing or other maneuvers until definitive care is reached. If using the frozen extremity for mobility is considered, a risk-benefit analysis should consider the potential for further trauma and possible poorer outcomes. Although it is reasonable to walk on a foot with frostbitten toes for evacuation purposes, it is inadvisable to walk  on an entirely frostbitten foot because of the potential for resulting morbidity. If using a frozen extremity for locomotion or evacuation is unavoidable, the extremity should be padded, splinted, and kept as immobile as possible to minimize additional trauma. Measures should be taken to protect frozen tissue to prevent further trauma. 32.  Specific recommendations Scenario 2. Therapeutic options for frostbite in scenario 2 include the following:  a.""

This element also aims to explain the importance of communications and stakeholder engagement which at the highest level is set out in the Defence Safety Operating Model. Purpose and expectations 2. This element focuses on the mechanisms the Defence organisation has in place to identify its internal and external stakeholders and communicate and engage with these stakeholders on safety matters. Identification of stakeholders 3. Defence organisations should identify their stakeholders who are impacted by its activities and understand their needs and expectations. This should inform the design of the Defence organisation’s Safety Management System (SMS) and their stakeholder engagement planning. 4. A stakeholder mapping exercise to consider their influence and impact is an effective way to prioritise stakeholder engagement for Defence organisations and assist them to develop a ‘communications and engagement plan’. The plan should be reviewed and updated as appropriate and should consist of: a. a set of communication and engagement objectives that are agreed with key stakeholders and approved by senior leaders; b. a stakeholder map, identifying target stakeholders / audiences, their information needs, and the methods / channels for communications and engagement; c. an actively managed forward-plan of tactical activity to deliver against the specific objectives; and d. a method of evaluating the impact / success of the communication and engagement activities (ideally with metrics), the findings should be acted on to improve delivery against objectives and increase audience satisfaction / participation. 5. Defence organisations should understand and fulfil their legal obligations and regulatory requirements with regards to safety stakeholder engagement and communication which should be clearly identified and understood at every level of the organisation. The law sets out how organisations are to consult their employees on safety matters in different situations and the choices they are required to make. There are two general regulations that set out an employer’s duty to consult their workforce with regards to safety issues and they are: a. The Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 b. The Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 19961 1 The 1996 regulations only apply to workforces that are not covered by TU recognition.""

Defence organisations should document (with the help of all stakeholders concerned) and communicate across the Defence organisation, and wider Defence where necessary, any lessons learned from previous infrastructure design, acquisition, manufacture, operation, modification and maintenance activities, where they may prevent recurrence of any safety issues. 20. All safety concerns on the Defence estate and any required actions must be communicated to the relevant stakeholders (for example users or maintainers) in a timely manner as identified in the Defence organisation’s communications plan. Procedures must be in place to notify users and potential users of infrastructure that is determined to be defective or inappropriate for specific uses. 21. Continuous and coherent performance management and assurance is critical to ensuring Defence infrastructure is delivered and maintained to meet user requirements within policy, standards and funding constraints. Defence organisations should monitor performance against the agreed PoW captured in their CIDPs and focus on maintaining a safe and compliant estate against the cost and time of programme delivery. 22. A culture of continual improvement, collaboration and communication throughout the IOM and whole life management activities is required to ensure all organisations learn from experience to improve their approaches to safety, in an efficient and effective way. Roles and responsibilities 23. Accountability, roles and responsibilities for managing safety across the whole scope, activities and lifecycle of the Defence Estate are articulated in the IOM. Those with clear safety responsibilities for Defence establishments such as the Head of Establishment (HoE) must be formally appointed into such roles and once appointed they should be able to demonstrate that they have accepted that role. Further detail on HoE responsibilities are covered in Annex D to this Volume 2. Element summary 24. Defence organisation leaders should make sure that their organisations: a. Have mechanisms in place to identify and assess safety risks and requirements associated with infrastructure throughout its entire lifecycle. b. Have mechanisms to ensure risks associated with infrastructure are adequately controlled and mitigated through its entire lifecycle and where necessary elevated to the appropriate management level. c. Have mechanisms to ensure infrastructure is compliant with statute or a disapplication or derogation throughout its lifecycle and where necessary an exemption is in place where compliance is not achievable. d. Have processes in place to ensure infrastructure is maintained and operated within defined design intent. Mechanisms are in place to communicate these processes to the workforce that operate and maintain the infrastructure. e.

However, MOD will intervene if necessary regarding factual errors and sensitive matters of operational/national security (including confidentiality of Special Forces) and issues relating to the personal security and duty of care of our personnel (e.g. identification of dead or injured).

In all other circumstances, the normal rules for licensing/contracting location filming activities apply. Media Support Scheme (formerly Editors Abroad) 34. The MOD engages with media at all levels and regional, local and specialist press are key to the communication effort. However, such media might find the costs of visits to units prohibitive, especially on deployed operations to combat theatres, and the Media Support Scheme (formerly known as the Editors Abroad Scheme) is an effective method of supporting such access. The scheme is funded by DDC and is tri-Service. Further details can be found at DIN 2013DIN03-011. Changes during the Development of the Project 35. Any changes to the scope of projects must lead to the re-evaluation of risks and entered on the DCEP and other relevant documents.

Provision is made with respect to the Reserve Forces by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96), as amended by the Armed Forces Act 2006 (AFA 06) and the Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14). RFA 96 provides for the call-out and recall of Reserve Forces for permanent service. This process is also referred to as ‘mobilisation’ and serves as the primary mechanism for reservists to undertake military operations or other authorised military tasks. 2. For the purposes of this JSP, mobilisation is the process by which an individual reservist, or group of reservists, is brought into permanent service. Failure to attend for service on call-out without leave lawfully granted or a reasonable justification is an offence under RFA 96. However, reservists and employers have the right to apply for deferral of, or exemption from, a reservist’s liability to be mobilised or, in the case of persons already serving, release or discharge from service. RFA 96 limits the periods for which reservists may be required to serve when mobilised. Once brought into permanent service, reservists attract many of the same rights and benefits as their Regular counterparts. In addition, their civilian employment rights are protected and both the employer and reservist may be entitled to claim financial assistance. 3. The Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14) amended RFA 96 to allow the Secretary of State (SofS) for Defence to authorise the mobilisation of Reserve Forces if it appears to the Secretary of State that it is necessary or desirable to use reservists for any purpose for which members of the Regular services may be used2. This amendment significantly broadened the circumstances in which reservists could be mobilised. The intent of DRA 14, as a key component of the Future Reserves 2020 programme, was to enable reservists to be effectively integrated within the Whole Force, making a valuable, flexible and sustainable contribution to Defence capability. The Reserve Forces 4. The UK Reserve Forces consist of: a. Volunteer Reserve Forces. Volunteers who accept an annual training commitment and a liability for call-out for permanent service. The Volunteer Reserve Forces are the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR), the Army Reserve3, and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF). 1 The Whole Force was introduced in the 2011 Defence Reform Review to ensure that Defence is supported by the most sustainable, effective, integrated and affordable balance of Regular military personnel, Reservists, MOD civilians and contractors. 2 The new, broader call-out liability introduced by DRA 14 does not apply automatically to those who joined the Reserve or Regular Forces before 1 October 2014, but such persons may elect to accept that liability""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 18.pdf, page 5: "". 22 An alien is also not permitted to become a member of the reserve forces because an alien is not a British citizen residing in the UK – see s.10 Reserve Forces Act 1996 – although Regulations made under s.4 of that Act can make exceptions to this (e.g. Territorial Army Regulations 1978).""

To retain the support of employers and the ability to mobilise reservists for priority tasks, taking into account that there are limits on the duration of permanent service within set periods, reservists should not routinely be mobilised solely to conduct training, professional / personal development activities, or provide training support which is not directly related to operations. Such activities should be undertaken under Sections 22, 24, 25 or 27 of RFA 96.

SCs are responsible for force generation within their respective Service and deciding on whether there is a requirement to mobilise reservists for an operation or task. This will normally be established following a review of the operational Statement of Requirement (SOR) or CDS Directive which will detail the capabilities required for any task. b. Call-Out / Recall Order. A call-out order provides legal authority to mobilise reservists. A recall order provides lawful authority to mobilise persons liable to recall. A call-out order is not required to mobilise High Readiness Reserves (HRR) or Sponsored Reserves (SR). The authority to issue a call-out notice can be delegated by the Secretary of State for Defence to the Minister for Armed Forces (Min AF) or the relevant SC. c. Selection of Personnel for Mobilisation. Defence seeks to reduce mobilisation risk11 by applying selection filters before issuing call-out notices. These include the willingness, suitability and availability of a reservist to deploy. This process is known 9 In accordance with the Defence DAOTO Directive (held at OS) and 2019DIN03-017. 10 This process is focussed on enduring, planned and small-medium scale operations.

These rights are laid out in the Safeguard of Employment Act 1985 (SOE 85) which applies to all reservists.  Your rights You have a right to be re-employed in the type of job in which you were last employed on terms and conditions no less favourable to you than previously; or if this is not reasonable and practicable, to be re-employed in the most favourable job and on the most favourable terms and conditions which are reasonable and practicable in your case. As long as your application is in force, your former employer must re-employ you as soon as he/she is reasonably able to do so from the date you said you would be ready for work. Five golden rules 1 Communicate with your former employer as soon as possible after demobilisation. Don’t leave it till later. 2 Make sure you keep a copy of everything you send to your employer and everything he/she sends you (keep notes of telephone conversations, etc). 3 Make sure that your former employer has received the letters which you send. (such as using Royal Mail Special Delivery to ensure receipt and tracking).  4 Remember to write formally to your employer no later than the third Monday after your last day of full-time military service (see page 8) if you have not already been given your job back. 5 If you are not sure about anything ask SaBRE for help on 0800 389 5459.  3  Return to work flowchart Yes  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  No  No  No further action  No further  action  Write informally to your civilian  employer (see page 5)  After your last day of service  (see page 8) write formally to  your civillian employer.

Mobilised reservists are to be identified on NOTICAS in line with the instructions in JSP 751 (Joint Casualty and Compassionate Policy and Procedures) Chapter 2. Welfare 12. Family Support. The provision of welfare support for the families of reservists is fundamental to ensuring that the reservist element of any deployed force is effective. The families of reservists do not expect support over and above that afforded their Regular counterparts but their needs and the methods of meeting these needs do differ. Commanders at all levels need to be aware of and understand these differences. 13. Regular Reserve. The needs of the Regular Reserve differ further from those of the Volunteer Reserve in that regular reservists are likely to come from different parts of the United Kingdom and abroad and thus lack the focus of a unit structure before, during and after permanent service. Again, commanders must be aware of each individual’s circumstances. 14. Mental Health. All reservists are to be briefed fully on stress, the Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) system and the support available to them both during the mobilisation process and again during demobilisation. Further information can be found in JSP 950 Leaflet 2-7-1 (Mental Health and Wellbeing Briefing, Before During and After Deployment). The Reserves Mental Health Programme provides assessment and treatment for reservists who have been deployed overseas since 1 Jan 03 as a reservist and believe their deployment may have affected their mental health. Further information can be found in JSP 950 Leaflet 2-7-2 (Defence Mental Health Services). Post Deployment Reports for Employers - Guidance 15. All mobilised reservists are to receive a post deployment letter aimed at their employers from their Unit Employer Support Officers (UESOs), detailing what they have achieved during their deployment and what qualifications and / or skills they have learned / developed. This formalises best practice by briefing employers, in readily understandable terminology, on the activities of their reservist employee during a period of mobilised service and is in addition to a Serviceperson’s Joint Appraisal Report.

Providing SP and SL meet all the eligibility criteria, they may make ELC claims in up to three separate FYs (which need not be consecutive and may be a combination of Lower Tier and Higher Tier awards) either while in Service or generally for 5 years after discharge16. ELC funds may be directed at one Learning Purpose (such as successive years’ study towards a particular qualification) or different Purposes in each of the 3 years.

Undertaking ELC funded study does not confer duty status and sS regulations should provide further clarification, if required. 3.3 Membership 4. Prior to 1 Apr 16 SP had to be in Service both when they applied and when they were registered as members of the ELC scheme. Acknowledgement letters for membership were forwarded to SP via Ed Staff, to be retained by the SP in their Personal Development Record (PDR).

SL who chose not to register for the scheme in their 1st year of service may have registered as members of the ELC scheme before 1 Apr 16 by completing an ELC application form during a six-month window between the 8 and 8½ year Service point, measured from their enlistment date. They may not make an ELC claim unless they have completed the required qualifying service, which is measured from: if the person left service before 1 Apr 16, the first day of the six-month window; or in all other cases, whichever is the later of 1 Apr 2000 and the date of enlistment.""

This guidance contains advice set out in a number of annexes, and appendices including the legal background to the employment of transgender Service personnel. Information is also included regarding the handling of applications to join the Services and the management and support of transgender individuals within the Services. Advice is also included on the medical care and treatment of transgender Service people, as well as information on support groups. Setting the Context 5. The Equality Act 2010 re-enacted and consolidated provisions that were previously contained in a number of disparate discrimination enactments1. Amongst other things, the 2010 Act prohibits employers from discriminating, victimising or harassing those in employment because of a protected characteristic. Gender reassignment is one of the nine protected characteristics listed in the 2010 Act. Additionally, the 2010 Act imposes a duty (‘the public sector equality duty’) on public authorities.

In the past, training establishments have tended to prepare for each 2nd and 3rd party assurance visit, with a largely reactive approach. This has resulted in a lack of integration of effort and continuity of effect, with establishment and unit responses and improvement plans being driven mainly by external programmes and agendas. The concept of CI helps to overcome these weaknesses. 17. The concept. CI is a proactive concept that comprises 2 main activities to be implemented at establishment and unit level, and amongst groups of similar training establishments: a. Self-assessment. Rigorous self-assessment is the fundamental tool by which CI is delivered.

An inclusive working environment ensures the sustainability of diversity of thought, perspectives, skills, talents and backgrounds. Diversity and inclusion are therefore critical to Defence’s success in safeguarding our nation’s security, stability and prosperity, as well as creating an inclusive working environment and culture capable of attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. 1.9. Effective leadership is an essential component. Defence will ensure leaders at all levels have the skills to demonstrate and champion inclusion that will create a ‘Just Culture’, one which creates a positive working environment and ensures unacceptable behaviours are eliminated promptly. Challenge unacceptable behaviours 1.10. Everyone has a duty to challenge unacceptable behaviours. It is important to bring critical thinking or embrace diversity of thought at all times and challenge where you believe behaviours are unacceptable. The Chilcot report states that this is not optional; it is the duty of all personnel within Defence to invite and offer challenge to unacceptable behaviours. 1.11. Appropriate challenge is about the issue, not the person, position or rank. It is also necessary to ward off ‘Groupthink’ or the practice of thinking or making decisions as a group in a way that discourages individual responsibility. An environment in which challenge is expected and accepted is important, as these cultures and behaviours reflect a healthy organisation. 1.12. Everyone in Defence is responsible for their own behaviours by: a. upholding and role-modelling the core behaviours set out above; b. speaking out and challenging unacceptable behaviour; c. supporting others who have experienced or witnessed unacceptable behaviour; d. ensuring their own conduct does not amount to bullying, harassment or discrimination (BHD) and they treat others with dignity and respect; e. reporting unacceptable behaviours against themselves or others as soon as possible; and f. maintaining confidentiality of such matters at all times, including once processes have been concluded. 1.13.

103,How is the AFPS 75 pension calculated?,"The AFPS 75 pension is calculated as three times the individual's final salary, if the death occurs during service and the deceased was a member of AFPS 75 only. If the deceased's salary at the date of death was less than £25,000, then the dependants will receive the difference between their salary and the BG amount (£25,000). No answer to this question has been found in the provided reference text regarding how the AFPS 75 pension is calculated for individuals who are still alive or when the death occurs after service.

Please note if an individual’s AFPS 75 pension is in payment, even if it is subject to abatement, then he can not aggregate that period of service for pension purposes and therefore this period of service will not count as relevant service towards his Compensation Lump Sum (CLS). If an individual completed less than two years service under AFPS 75 then this time would not have counted as qualifying service towards an AFPS 75 preserved pension and therefore no aggregation can take place and this service can not count as relevant service for the CLS.

(ii) Uncompleted Service. This is that part of the person’s current Regular service commitment that he was not able to complete because of the redundancy. 0206. Measuring Length of Service. To determine the length of ‘completed service’ and ‘uncompleted service’, the days in excess of the period of whole years are converted into years by dividing the number of days by 365 and calculating the result to 4 decimal places as shown in Example 1. EXAMPLE 1 – Measuring ‘Service’ in Years and Part Years to 4 Decimal Places • A period of ‘completed service’ or ‘uncompleted service’ that occurred between 1 May 2010 and 31 October 2019 (inclusive) would count as 9 years 184 days. • After calculating the days into years (184/365 = 0.5041), the length of service is 9 + 0.5041 = 9.5041 years.""

The amount paid as BG also depends on whether the death occurs during or after service. This is due to the differing pension benefits paid through the AFPS depending on whether the death occurs during or after service. 4.33. The BG was developed as a part of the AFCS to recognise that where an individual dies as a result of service, their partner and/or child(ren) should not receive a lower lump sum than they may have done if the deceased had been a member of AFPS 2005 or AFPS 2015. As a result, depending on the pension scheme that the person was a member of, and whether the death occurs during or after service, their pension lump sum is enhanced where appropriate by payment of a BG. 4.34. Where an individual dies in service one of the following amounts are payable: • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 75 only, their dependant(s) will receive a BG of £25,000. • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 05 only or AFPS 15 (including those who have accrued rights to AFPS 75 or 05) and their salary at the date of death was less than £25,000, their dependant(s) will receive the difference between their salary and the BG amount, for example if their salary was £16,000 per annum, their dependants will receive a payment of £9,000. If their salary at date of death was above £25,000 then no BG is payable. 4.35. If the death occurs after the individual has left service, the BG is paid regardless of the pension scheme of the deceased. The amount payable is one and a half times the base level of BG in order to compensate for the smaller lump sum that is payable from the member’s pension scheme where death occurs after service – so the BG payable in these circumstances is £37,500. 4.36.

EXAMPLE 5 – Leaving With More Than 40 years’ Reckonable Service (1) Scenario. • He was due to leave service at age 62; a total commitment of 44 years. • He completed 40 years 303 days (40.8301 years) relevant service before actually leaving. • The uncompleted portion of his service commitment was (44 – 40.8301) years = 3.1699 years. • His final relevant earnings (FRE) at OF8 rank were £138,000. (2) Redundancy Terms. The senior officer is over age 55 on leaving. He has over 3 years uncompleted service but has more than 40 years’ reckonable service to count towards his AFPS 05 pension. Under AFRS 06 rules, his CLS is limited to half his final relevant earnings. (3) Calculation Formula. Lump Sum would normally have been calculated as: FRE/4 x uncompleted service (3.1699 years) = £138,000/4 x 3.1699 = £109,361.55 but as he has over 40 years’ reckonable service, CLS is limited FRE/2. (4) CLS. = £138,000/ 2 = £69,000. (5) Other Benefits. The senior officer is also entitled to receive immediate payment of his pension and pension lump sum. CALCULATION OF COMPENSATION - SHORT SERVICE COMMITMENTS 0216. Basis for Calculation. If a person, who was serving on a short term commitment (see para 0209), is made redundant, a CLS is to be paid to him on leaving. The amount of the CLS is to be determined by finding the lower of: (a) FRE/8 x completed service, or (b) the sum of (1) FRE/8 x each year of uncompleted service, and (2) FRE/8. where the terms: FRE - means final relevant earnings, and Uncompleted service - is defined at para 0205""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 764 Part 1.pdf, page 64: ""If the lump sum payable under AFPS 05 is larger than the lump sum received under the GPS, the pension will be increased on a permanent basis to take account of the fact that HMRC rules prevent the payment of a second pension commencement lump sum (see example at para 1123). 1127. For those described in paras 1125 (a) and 1126, any subsequent dependants’ benefits will be paid in accordance with normal AFPS 05 rules. So, for example, the spouse’s pension would be calculated by multiplying the member’s final pensionable earnings by the amount of reckonable service he was allowed to count, and the result multiplied by 1/112. However, it is understood that there is nobody within the scope of the AFPS 05 GOTT who falls into this category. 1128. For those described at para 1125 (b), their GPS pension will be replaced by EDP benefits. The amount of the pension which will come into payment when they reach age 65 will be calculated by the Scheme Actuary, taking into account the HMRC rule which does not allow the payment of a second pension commencement lump sum. The EDP will be calculated in the usual way (see Part 2 of this JSP). EDP payments will be backdated to the last day of service and arrears will be adjusted to take account of the amount of GPS pension already paid. 1129. For those described at para 1125 (b) and 1128, subsequent dependants’ benefits will be paid under AFPS 05 rules. 1130. For those described in para 1125 (c), their GPS pension will remain in payment until age 65. They will not be proper preserved pensioners and they will not be allowed to transfer their benefits out or to claim their pension before age 65. They will not become members of AFPS 05 until they are 65. The amount of the pension which will come into payment when they reach age 65 will be calculated by the Scheme Actuary, taking into account the amount of pension already paid from the date of their retirement to age 65. HMRC rules prevent the payment of a second pension commencement lump sum and, in the event that, after the Actuary’s calculations, one is due, a higher pension will be paid at age 65 on a permanent basis instead (see example at para 1123). If he dies before reaching age 65, his eligible dependants will receive GPS, not AFPS 05, benefits.

The effects of any assignment within the resettlement phase and withdrawals from the scheme should be carefully understood. Normally, failure to complete the activity or breaks in study outside of the usual term time breaks, will result in any further application being denied. A Gap year is not permitted under the Scheme unless this is integral to the course, e.g. to undertake a work placement as part of a ‘year in Industry’ requirement.

The course fee must include any existing discounts or fee reductions. The claim must state the MOD contribution (up to a maximum of £1k or £2k depending on Tier eligibility) with the remaining balance (the amount which would have equated to the individual’s personal contribution).

105,What death-in-service benefits are members of the reserve forces entitled to?,"Members of the volunteer Reserve are entitled to a tax-free lump sum in lieu of untaken leave proportionate to their attendance for obligatory training or paid voluntary training and other duties (JSP 760 Part 1.pdf, paragraphs 1.15 and 1.18). In addition, if a reservist dies while in permanent Service, they will also be entitled to the same death-in-service benefits as regular service personnel (JSP 760 Part 1.pdf, paragraph 1.15). However, there is no entitlement for other types of leave not based on attendance, such as sick absence or compassionate leave (JSP 760 Part 1.pdf, paragraph 1.16).

There is also a Bereavement Grant (BG) payable to the estate of a reservist who dies in service, which is one and a half times the base level of BG if the death occurs after the individual has left service (JSP 765.pdf, paragraphs 4.31-4.36). The exact amount of the grant depends on whether the death occurs during or after service and the pension scheme of the deceased (JSP 765.pdf, paragraphs 4.33-4.36).

No answer to this question has been found in the provided reference text regarding the entitlement of reservists to a tax-free lump sum equivalent to four times their pensionable earnings if they die while in service or after leaving the Armed Forces (JSP 764 Part 3.pdf, paragraphs 0411-0415)","['This passage is from JSP 760 Part 1.pdf, page 23: ""for Service reasons or where, exceptionally, Service personnel request an unusually long period of leave for personal reasons.

Death in Service – Payment for Untaken Leave (UTL) 1.15. It is MOD policy that all personnel must take their full leave entitlement, and it is imperative that individuals do not build up amounts of leave which they may be unable to take at a later date. However, with effect from 1 April 2009, where an individual has died while in Service and therefore has leave outstanding, the MOD will make payments to the deceased’s estate in lieu of that UTL. This includes Annual Leave, Post Operational Leave, and Seagoer’s Leave. If an individual has also accrued Re-engagement leave and Paternity Leave, but was unable to take them for operational reasons, this leave would also be included. Service personnel must make sure that all leave is accurately recorded on JPA thus ensuring that their NOK are not disadvantaged as a result of incorrect data on the system. Reserve personnel who die whilst in permanent Service will also be entitled to this and will be treated the same as Regulars.

When managing the RSDs allocated to a volunteer Reserve SP, leave is to be treated as exclusive to the RSD commitment cap (i.e. a PTVR commitment with an RSD cap of 90 days would result in an additional 9.25 days of paid leave allocated to the SP).""

If a preserved member dies, his deferred pension lump sum will be paid to his nominated recipient(s), his spouse, civil partner or eligible partner or, if he has none of these, to his estate.

PENSIONS FOR SPOUSES, CIVIL PARTNERS OR ELIGIBLE PARTNERS Eligibility 0416. If an active member with two years’ qualifying service, a deferred member or a pensioner member dies leaving a spouse or civil partner, the surviving spouse or civil partner is entitled to a pension for life. Under the provision of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, civil partners will be treated similarly to spouses as far as is reasonably practicable. 0417. Under the provisions of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 which came into force on 13 March 2014, same sex spouses will be treated similarly to civil partners. If the marriage or civil partnership ceremony took place less than six months before the member’s death, the pension may be withheld, although the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) may not. (For information on GMP see Chapter 3, paras 0327-0329.) In deciding whether the pension should be withheld Chief Defence Personnel Remuneration AFPS 05 Pol (CDP Rem AFPS 05 Pol) will consider all the facts.

The amount paid as BG also depends on whether the death occurs during or after service. This is due to the differing pension benefits paid through the AFPS depending on whether the death occurs during or after service. 4.33. The BG was developed as a part of the AFCS to recognise that where an individual dies as a result of service, their partner and/or child(ren) should not receive a lower lump sum than they may have done if the deceased had been a member of AFPS 2005 or AFPS 2015. As a result, depending on the pension scheme that the person was a member of, and whether the death occurs during or after service, their pension lump sum is enhanced where appropriate by payment of a BG. 4.34. Where an individual dies in service one of the following amounts are payable: • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 75 only, their dependant(s) will receive a BG of £25,000. • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 05 only or AFPS 15 (including those who have accrued rights to AFPS 75 or 05) and their salary at the date of death was less than £25,000, their dependant(s) will receive the difference between their salary and the BG amount, for example if their salary was £16,000 per annum, their dependants will receive a payment of £9,000. If their salary at date of death was above £25,000 then no BG is payable. 4.35. If the death occurs after the individual has left service, the BG is paid regardless of the pension scheme of the deceased. The amount payable is one and a half times the base level of BG in order to compensate for the smaller lump sum that is payable from the member’s pension scheme where death occurs after service – so the BG payable in these circumstances is £37,500. 4.36.

106,What financial incentives are available to medical officers?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 764 Part 4.pdf, Medical Officers (MO/DOs) are entitled to bonus payments under the Medical and Dental Officer Bonus Scheme as introduced in Chapter 7 of the document. The bonus arrangements replace the benefits available under AFPS 05 and the Commission Transfer Grant (CTG). The bonus payments vary depending on the primary or secondary care group, with different payment patterns for each group. The primary care MO/DOs receive three bonus payments: the first primary care bonus, second primary care bonus, and third primary care bonus. Secondary Care Consultants receive two bonus payments: the first secondary care bonus and the second secondary care bonus. All bonus payments attract a five-year return of service requirement, and failure to complete the required period of service will result in the whole bonus sum having to be repaid (JSP 764 Part 4.pdf, pages 1 and 3).

Therefore, the financial incentives for medical officers include bonus payments as part of the Medical and Dental Officer Bonus Scheme. The specific amounts and timing of these bonus payments depend on the primary or secondary care group and the commission transfer status of the officer (JSP 764 Part 4.pdf, pages 1 and 3).

A general principle of the bonus scheme is that an individual who has received a bonus under either the primary or secondary care category will be eligible only for future bonus payments in that same category.

107,How is financial compensation calculated for people made redundant from service?,"The financial compensation for people made redundant from service is calculated based on their final relevant earnings (FRE) and the length of their completed and uncompleted service. If a person has completed sufficient service to qualify for Early Departure Payment (EDP), their compensation is calculated as their FRE divided by 8, multiplied by the number of completed years of service (Paras 0314, 0211, and examples provided). However, if they have insufficient service to qualify for EDP, the compensation is calculated as the lower of: (a) one-eighth of their annual pay for each year of redundancy reckonable service or (b) the sum of one-eighth of their annual pay for each year of uncompleted service and one-eighth of their annual pay (Paras 0314, 0216).

Additionally, a person may be entitled to an Immediate Pension (IP) or a Preserved Pension, depending on whether they have completed sufficient qualifying service. The IP is calculated using a pro-rata rate of the 16-year Rate for Retired Pay on Compulsory Retirement in issue on the day following their last day of reckonable service if they do not have 16 years’ or more reckonable service (Paras 0317, 0319). In some cases, a Resettlement Grant may also be payable in addition to the compensation (Paras 0318, 0319).

Under no circumstances is an individual to be given an assurance that they will leave under DER terms until formal approval has been received from the CSP. CSP consideration will normally take up to 6 weeks, although the Panel will be guided by target timescales for response as stated in the submission. For Army officers of 1-star and above and for RN/RM and RAF officers of 2-star and above, the assumption will be that service will cease following the end of the current tour, without payment of a SCP, if no offer of further employment is made at least 6 months before the end of tour.

If the individual is not happy with the decision made they can pursue through IDRP (see Chapter 9, para 0913). 0418""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 765.pdf, page 36: ""4.31. Under the AFPS 197519, the death in service lump sum paid20 is equal to three times the individual’s final salary, whereas under the AFPS 200521 and AFPS 201522 the lump sum is equal to four times the individual’s final salary. 4.32. The amount paid as BG also depends on whether the death occurs during or after service. This is due to the differing pension benefits paid through the AFPS depending on whether the death occurs during or after service. 4.33. The BG was developed as a part of the AFCS to recognise that where an individual dies as a result of service, their partner and/or child(ren) should not receive a lower lump sum than they may have done if the deceased had been a member of AFPS 2005 or AFPS 2015. As a result, depending on the pension scheme that the person was a member of, and whether the death occurs during or after service, their pension lump sum is enhanced where appropriate by payment of a BG. 4.34. Where an individual dies in service one of the following amounts are payable: • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 75 only, their dependant(s) will receive a BG of £25,000. • If the deceased was a member of AFPS 05 only or AFPS 15 (including those who have accrued rights to AFPS 75 or 05) and their salary at the date of death was less than £25,000, their dependant(s) will receive the difference between their salary and the BG amount, for example if their salary was £16,000 per annum, their dependants will receive a payment of £9,000. If their salary at date of death was above £25,000 then no BG is payable. 4.35. If the death occurs after the individual has left service, the BG is paid regardless of the pension scheme of the deceased. The amount payable is one and a half times the base level of BG in order to compensate for the smaller lump sum that is payable from the member’s pension scheme where death occurs after service – so the BG payable in these circumstances is £37,500. 4.36. Separate provisions apply for Reservists (see Chapter 7). 19 Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975. 20 From 1 April 2022, all active service personnel are members of AFPS 15.

110,When can I make a claim from the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 765.pdf, page 4, the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) provides compensation for injury or illness caused or made worse by service on or after 6 April 2005. There is no distinction between injuries sustained during operations, training, or while undertaking specified activities to maintain fitness. The time limits for making a claim depend on the specific circumstances of the injury or illness. For some illnesses with a late onset, the time limit can be extended for a further three years from the date of diagnosis. In cases where an individual leaves service and dies of an injury or illness caused by service within seven years of having left service, a claim for compensation must be made within three years of the bereavement. A claim for a fast payment can be made within six months from the date of the injury. If an individual is physically or mentally incapable of making a claim themselves, the time limit can be extended. It is important to note that the AFCS is a no-fault scheme and receiving an award does not indicate negligence on the part of MOD in the injury, illness, or death being sustained. (Reference: JSP 765.pdf, pages 39-40","['This passage is from JSP 765.pdf, page 4: ""Chapter 2 - Eligibility Entitlement 2.1. Awards under the WPS are based on causation. Individuals may be entitled to a payment if they suffer injury wholly or partly as a result of their service in the Armed Forces. Payment under the WPS is not restricted to those injured during operations; injuries incurred during regular peacetime training or on exercise are also covered. 2.2. Awards under the Scheme are made for any disablement, either mental or physical, provided there is a causal link to service. There are no time limits for claiming; however, the test for causal link to service changes after seven years. 2.3. Payments under the WPS can only be made once an individual leaves service; there is no entitlement to payment whilst still in service. 2.4. An individual may be entitled to benefits because of a relationship to an Armed Forces member (i.e., eligible dependant). Also, in certain circumstances some individuals who were not members of the Armed Forces may be eligible to be considered under one of a number of minor schemes which operate on similar lines to the WPS. Details on these schemes can be found at Chapter 8. Burden of Proof 2.5. If a claim is made not later than seven years after the termination of an individual’s service in the Armed Forces and there is a reasonable doubt that disablement is due to or aggravated by service, the benefit of doubt is given to the claimant. 2.6. If a claim is made more than seven years after the termination of an individual’s service in the Armed Forces, the benefit of reasonable doubt is given to the claimant where, upon reliable evidence, a reasonable doubt exists that the disablement is attributable to or aggravated by service. 2.7. The same Burden of Proof applies in the case of the death of the former member of the Armed Forces and a dependant’s claim (see Chapter 4). 2.8. This approach differs from other jurisdictions both nationally and internationally, including the insurance industry, personal injury civil litigation, and other MOD and public sector schemes. Evidence and Complex Cases 2.9. Each case is considered on its own merits. War Pensions are medically certified with relevant material facts including on claimed incidents, events and exposures decided by DBS lay decision-makers who are supported by training and guidance on scheme policy, legislation and case law. 2.10. Most cases are relatively straightforward in terms of establishing whether the disablement claimed was caused by service. Given the varied nature of service life and that there are no time limits to claim, there can be instances where it is difficult to establish whether an injury is caused by service or not.

The change brings the War Pension and Armed Forces Compensation Chamber in line with all other tribunals in England and Wales. 8.30. If living in England and Wales and the decision was notified on or after 6 April 2023 the individual must complete the appeal form WPAF1 which is available online at https://www.gov.uk/war-pension-armed-forces-compensation-tribunal/how-to-appeal. If the claimant has completed a paper form it will need to be sent to the First-tier Tribunal - War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation, PO Box 10875, Arnhem House, Leicester, LE1 8FE or email to armedforces.chamber@justice.gov.uk. If the decision was made on or before 5 April 2023, the claimant should send the appeal form to DBS. 8.31 If living in Scotland, the individual must complete a form and send it to the Scottish Pensions Appeal Tribunal directly at the following address: Pensions Appeal Tribunal, George House, 126 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2 4HH. The form can be obtained from www.gov.uk at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/armed-forces-compensation or by calling the DBS Helpline on 0808 1914218. 8.32 If living in Northern Ireland, the individual must complete an appeal form and send it to DBS at the following address: Defence Business Services, Norcross, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, FY5 3WP. 8.33. Once the appeal application is lodged and DBS receive a copy of the appeal from the Tribunal, DBS prepare a bundle of documents relevant to the appeal and these are passed to the Tribunal service. DBS will also provide the individual and their representative (if they have one) with a copy of the bundle of documents. 8.34. The Tribunal will provide the individual with information on the appeal procedure. The individual bringing the appeal is advised to attend the tribunal hearing. Tribunal hearings can be held remotely (via video conferencing or telephone) or in person. Oral evidence provided by the individual may be relevant to the Tribunal and can provide confidence that their case has been fully heard. 8.35. The Royal British Legion and other service charities provide a free service to support people through the process. They can attend the hearing with or on behalf of the appellant. Appellants may choose to be represented by a third party, however DBS will not be able to provide any assistance with the cost of this decision. In addition, this may result in the individual only receiving some of the award if the appeal is successful. These companies are not endorsed by the MOD. Using them will be at the expense of the individual. DBS can be represented at the hearing. The tribunal hearings are open to the public. 8.36""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 765.pdf, page 39: ""5.5. This means there should be sufficient time for an individual to make a claim. If a relatively minor injury is sustained as a result of service, it might be that the individual wants to make the claim immediately and move on. However, if the injuries are of a more serious nature and continued medical treatment is required, they may wish to delay their claim until their injuries are more settled and they have established their rehabilitative process. It is important to recognise that while an individual remains in service, they will continue to receive their salary and appropriate support from the Services. Award levels depend on assessing the claimed injury when it is in a treated steady medical state and/or prognosis is reasonably certain. Deferring claims until the ongoing disablement caused by an injury is clearer can, in many cases, be helpful by allowing awards to be made final with appeal rights; however, interim awards may be made (see paragraphs 3.36 to 3.38). 5.6. In some illness cases, the seven-year time limit can be extended for a further three years where the illness first started within the seven-year period but was not diagnosed until less than a year before the end of those seven years, so the individual may not have had sufficient time to make their claim. Illnesses with a Late Onset 5.7. The above time limits do not apply in cases where the illness (including mental health disorder) is medically considered a late-onset illness. In these cases, the time limit is three years from the date of diagnosis, whenever that diagnosis takes place. This provision applies to post-service claims only (i.e., it could be some decades after service has ended). Other Time Limits that Apply 5.8. If an individual leaves service and dies of an injury or illness caused by service within seven years of having left service, a claim for compensation must be made within three years of the bereavement. 5.9. A claim for a fast payment (see paragraphs 3.56 to 3.60) can be made within six months from the date of the injury. 5.10. If an individual is physically or mentally incapable of either making a claim themselves or instructing another person to do so on their behalf within the time limits, the time limit can be extended. Each case of this kind will be considered in the light of its specific circumstances. 5.11. There may be instances where an individual wants to either amend their claim or later decides not to pursue it at all. Where this happens, the individual should write to DBS to let them know as soon as possible. If the claim is withdrawn it cannot later be reinstated, though if this happens within the time limit, a new claim can be made. Relationship between AFCS and Common-Law Damages 5.12. The AFCS is a ‘no fault’ scheme, which means receiving an AFCS award does not indicate there has been negligence on the part of MOD in the injury, illness or death being sustained; in making a payment the MOD is not admitting any form of liability""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 765.pdf, page 4: ""SECTION 1 - ARMED FORCES COMPENSATION SCHEME Chapter 1 - Introduction Overview 1.1. The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) provides compensation for injury or illness caused or made worse by service; or where death is caused by service in the UK Armed Forces on or after 6 April 2005. The Scheme applies equally to Regular and Reserve forces. Compensation is paid for injuries2 which arise as a result of service, regardless of how they are sustained. No distinction is made between injuries sustained on operations, and those incurred during training, service-approved sport (see JSP 660), or while undertaking specified activities to maintain fitness. Recognising that members of the Armed Forces do not generally choose where they deploy and what activities they undertake as part of their service, the compensation scheme covers this wide spectrum of activities the Armed Forces undertake. 1.2. The AFCS is a no-fault scheme and is therefore different from awards for damages paid through the courts. If an individual believes they have been injured as a result of negligence, having an AFCS award does not prevent them from bringing a claim through the common law damages route, although an AFCS award would be taken into account in the damages payment (or vice versa). This is in keeping with the longstanding principle that an individual should not be compensated twice for the same injury. 1.3. The Scheme rules are set out in legislation in The Armed Forces and Reserve Forces (Compensation Scheme) Order 20113 and the Scheme is administered by Defence Business Services (DBS). This document lays out the policy behind the Scheme. Scheme Principles 1.4. The Scheme has been designed to be consistent with a number of fundamental underlying principles. These were examined and clarified by former Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral the Lord Boyce, during his wide-ranging review of the Scheme which was published in February 2010. These principles, as reinvigorated by Lord Boyce, are to: • Be fair. The arrangements guarantee a fair deal for all those who are entitled to compensation. The unique nature of military service is reflected by the nation’s continuing commitment to those who have been injured, with an appropriate recognition for their sacrifice. The arrangements deliver consistent and equitable outcomes, with due recognition to the needs of those most seriously injured who receive higher awards than those less seriously injured. • Be understandable, accessible, and transparent. Every effort is made to ensure that claimants are able to understand the basic elements of the Scheme and the claims 2 Where the term ‘injury’ appears in this context, it should be construed to include cases of illness or death, where appropriate to do so, unless specified otherwise.""

This element is to assist the Defence organisation to structure, facilitate and encourage flexibility and collaborative working, while managing the associated safety risks and dependencies. This includes: a.

Inter-organisational working, such as with other government departments and the supply chain, which brings in experience and expertise from external parties. Safety Management System (SMS) 3. A Safety Management System (SMS) is a formal management system or framework for managing safety. Having this in place can assist in achieving a balance between the systems and behavioural aspects of safety management and it treats safety management as an integral part of good management across the organisation. 4. Defence organisations are to develop and maintain an organisational SMS that reflects their activities and supports the Defence vision for safety and to ensure that there is a consistent approach to safety management. It could be a standalone system or it could be combined with an Environmental Management System (EMS) to become the Defence organisations SEMS. 5.

113,What is the difference between OPCOM and TACOM?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 815 Vol 2 Annex A.pdf (page 5), OPCOM (Operational Command) and TACOM (Tactical Command) are two different command states in military contexts.

OPCOM refers to the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units, and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as may be necessary. It is the authority to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned and does not include responsibility for administration or logistics.

TACOM, on the other hand, refers to the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. It is the detailed local direction and control of movement or maneuver which is necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks.

Therefore, OPCOM involves the assignment of operational missions and tasks, while TACOM involves the assignment of tactical tasks and the detailed control of their execution","['This passage is from JSP 815 Vol 2 Annex A.pdf, page 5: ""b. Operational Control (OPCON). OPCON is the authority delegated to a commander to direct assigned forces so that they may accomplish their specific missions or tasks, usually limited by function, time, or location, to deploy units concerned and to retain or assign tactical control to those units. OPCON allows a commander to issue missions and tasks to subordinates, within the scope of the mission issued by higher authority4. It does not include the authority to assign separate employment of components of the units concerned. Nor does it include administrative or logistic control. c. Tactical Command (TACOM). TACOM is the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. d. Tactical Control (TACON). TACON is the detailed local direction and control of movement, or manoeuvre which is necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks. 1-42. Control and Coordination Terms. The following terms may be ascribed independently to operational and tactical command states to delegate elements of authority: a. Administrative Control (ADCON). ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organisations in respect of administrative matters such as personnel management, supply, services and other issues not included in the operational mission of the subordinate or other organisations. Therefore, ADCON is assigned separately to a given command state. b. Logistic Control (LOGCON). LOGCON is the authority to execute logistics functions and activities within the agreed limits of logistic control in accordance with the Transfer of Authority5. c. Coordinating Authority (CA). CA is the authority granted to a commander, or an individual that assigns responsibility to them for the coordination of specific functions, or activities, involving forces of two or more countries, or commands, or two or more services, or two or more forces of the same service. The CA has authority to request consultation between the organisations involved or their representatives, but not to compel agreement. In the event of irreconcilable disagreement, the CA shall refer the matter to the appropriate higher authority. d. DIRLAUTH. DIRLAUTH is most commonly used by UK and some allied forces (US) to mean direct liaison authorised6. However, there is the potential for confusion with this term when operating with multinational partners. AJP-3(B) uses the term DIRLAUTH as Direct Liaison Authority, which is a synonym for CA.

This Direction & Guidance applies to all Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force and Joint Individual Training Providers throughout Defence that use TAFMIS. It also covers JPA OLM for those providers not provided with access to TAFMIS. 4.1 TAFMIS Scope 1. It is mandated that all organisations provided with TAFMIS are to use TAFMIS to manage the individual training, events, processes and resources of people engaged with Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 training. 17 This is essential to ensure a consistent approach to DSAT and to provide coherent and complete management information across Defence. 2. All other individual training organisations must instead use JPA OLM for course bookings, the recording of competences and completing training history. 3. TAFMIS directly enables the application of the DSAT process for Defence Training & Education. Details on TAFMIS services can be found in the briefing documents at TAFMIS PORTAL MOC Team TAFMIS Briefings and at Section 4.9 below. 4.

Army Field Manual (AFM) Command Command States: 1-38. A common understanding of the degrees of authority is a prerequisite for effective cooperation. Command arrangements must always be qualified by the DTG at which they begin. They should also specify the DTG at which they are likely to end and must accommodate the situation prior to and after transfer of authority (TOA). Note that when working in a multinational environment, the authority granted through command states must be clarified with the issuing commander. 1-39. Command States explain the status of formations, units and commanders, relative to each other. States of command are concerned primarily with the ability to assign an independent mission, to reorganise a unit to suit its task, or to direct specific tasks within an agreed mission. They exist in order to: a. Allow a higher headquarters to prioritise resources and effort. b. Protect the integrity of force structures and where appropriate to protect the independence of non-organic forces. c. Assist with force packaging when working with limited resources. In general, the command state should be set at the highest level possible, whereas control should be held at the lowest level possible. Control at too high a level can result in a loss of flexibility and tempo. Conversely, command at too low a level can result in the inability to concentrate resources and will hamper the ability to rapidly switch priorities. 1-40. Full Command (FULLCOM). FULLCOM is the military authority and responsibility of a commander to issue orders to subordinates. It covers every aspect of military operations and administration and exists only within national Services. The term \'command\', as used internationally, implies a lesser degree of authority than when it is used in a purely national sense. No NATO or coalition commander has FULLCOM over the assigned forces of other nations. Only OPCOM or OPCON (see below) can be delegated across national lines. 1-41. Operational and Tactical Command States: a. Operational Command (OPCOM). OPCOM is the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units and to reassign forces and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as may be necessary. It the authority to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned. It does not include responsibility for administration or logistics (see ADCON, below).""

The processes for managing risks will vary according to the circumstances of the deployment but should as a minimum, involve liaison between the Tasking Authority2, the Deploying Organisation3, the Force Generating Command4, the Operational Commander5 or the person who has been appointed to take charge of the activity and any specialist advisers required to provide subject matter expertise on specific areas of risk6. The process should also encourage environmental health staff to be included within reconnaissance parties in order to enable the early identification of environmental and industrial hazards. 7. During the planning of an overseas operation or deployed exercise the Deploying Organisation must undertake an Environmental and Industrial Hazards (EIH) assessment of the infrastructure or equipment to identify the presence of any reasonably foreseeable hazard(s) that could cause harm. This assessment should be conducted as part of a reconnaissance visit and must be conducted by a person trained and competent in the identification of EIH risks. 8. If for operational reasons an EIH assessment cannot be conducted via a reconnaissance visit, then the reasons must be documented and the EIH assessment completed prior to use of the infrastructure or equipment (or as soon as practicable after start of use if operational circumstances dictate) by a person trained and competent in the identification of EIH risks. 9. Due to the nature of deployment and operations, safety risk may need to be assessed on a dynamic basis to respond to an immediate or emerging threat.

Safety culture 10. Leaders in Defence set the strategic direction for safety which influences how individuals within Defence behave in relation to safety and defines the culture of the organisation. 11. Culture can be best understood as ""the way we do things around here"" and safety culture can be defined as “the product of individual and group values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies and patterns of behaviour that determine the commitment, style and proficiency of the organisation\'s safety management.” A safety culture builds slowly, but behaviours are influenced quickly through strong leadership, messaging, expectations, and examples, this is known as the ‘tone from the top’. 12. Building a strong culture of safety is vital to prevent accidents, injuries and deaths. Defence organisations should show genuine care to those who deliver Defence activities, support open and honest reporting and set a culture where everyone feels able to speak up before and not just after things go wrong, rather than fearing blame. They should maintain policies and processes that develop and promote a positive safety culture throughout their organisation and area of responsibility, they should share and effectively communicate good practice and any safety lessons identified in order to promote and support continuous improvement. Clear aims and objectives 13. Defence organisations have flexibility to describe the elements of a strong safety culture using their own language. However, clear aims and objectives are important as they ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and all involved parties take the right steps in achieving an effective safety culture. The following steps should be taken by Defence organisations to achieve this: a. leaders should set clear expectations and communicate a ‘tone from the top’ based around their ‘duty of care’ for the health, safety and wellbeing of their people; b. leaders at all levels should be visible and proactive in promoting safety; c. their safety policies and procedures should be maintained, continually monitored and improved to mitigate human error.""

Performance Establishing a baseline 5. Establishing a baseline is the starting point for effective performance management and will drive opportunities for the Defence organisation by preventing or reducing avoidable safety occurrences. It is important that once established, the baseline is captured as the original benchmark, from which to assess changes in performance. However, a major change may require a new baseline to be established. The safety baseline will comprise a variety of sources of information including but not exhaustively: a. Results of safety audits, particularly if these are provided independently by specifically commissioned external authorities such as regulators, both statutory and Defence; b. Peer reviews provided by other related organisations or comparative exercises; c. Data from accident and injury reporting, including trends; d.

Compliance performance verified by audit or from records of regular interventions; f. Measurement against other metrics; such as expenditure on safety training; and g. Assessments against safety culture models. Performance measurement 6. The measuring and reporting of safety performance is a necessary part of a “Plan, Do, Check, Act” approach. It allows Defence organisations to check how effectively legislation and Defence safety policy and regulations are being implemented, where the areas are that require improvement and where are the risks to performance. All these can be compared with the safety baseline. However, care should be taken not to report or use ineffective data and MI, which may obscure the key information: Not all information that can be measured needs to be reported. 7. The Defence organisation should establish, implement and maintain a process and a system for monitoring, measuring, analysing and evaluating performance which includes: a. Determining what needs to be monitored and measured, including: (1) The extent to which legal requirements and other requirements are fulfilled; (2) Its activities and operations related to identified hazards, risks and opportunities;""  ', '']"

The DSAT process aims to deliver robust, realistic and challenging training while avoiding the tendency to provide excessive training that may result in insufficient training in other areas. It is governed and managed in accordance with the Defence mandated Quality Management System (QMS) to ensure consistency and effectiveness across the organization.

Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives.

This chapter sets out the overarching context, framework and approach for Defence Learning and Development policy - and its implementation pan-Defence. 1.2 Context 2. The Defence People Strategy states that ‘Defence exists to protect the people of the United Kingdom, prevent conflict and be ready to fight the United Kingdom’s enemies. People are the difference that gives Defence its edge’3. To ensure operational success Defence must build, and maintain, a sustainable, diverse and skilled workforce. A key route to achieving this is maximising the talent of Defence’s workforce through modern learning provision and making better use of skills across Defence. Learning and Development is the process by which the skills Defence requires from its workforce are developed and sustained. 1.3 Use of ‘Training’ Terminology 3. The terms ‘Learning’, ‘Training’ and ‘Education’ are used in their own right in the JSP. However, the term ‘training’ is frequently used throughout the JSP to avoid repetition and to match current terminology in use across Defence. In these instances, the term ‘training’ encompasses training, education, learning or development, both individual and collective.""

118,How can I identify people who are at risk of exertional collapse?,"According to JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, individuals at risk of exertional collapse include those with personal risk factors such as dehydration, recent or current illness, recent vaccination, poor baseline conditioning/fitness level, excess body fat, prior poor fitness test performance, prior exercise-related collapse, accumulated fatigue, underlying cardiac condition, asthma, sickle cell trait, lack of appropriate environmental acclimatisation, high ambient temperature and humidity, certain medications, dietary supplements containing stimulants, and motivation or peer/command pressure (JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, pages 31-32). It is essential to recognize these risk factors early to enable timely intervention and ensure the safety of all participants. (Citation: JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, paragraphs 15-16","['This passage is from JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, page 31: ""15. An individual who is poorly performing or demonstrates distress during, or immediately after physical exercise, may be at risk of exertional collapse, and potentially even death. Poor performance and distress must be recognised early to enable timely intervention, including immediate cessation of the physical activity for all participants. Priority must be given to treating the individual. A dynamic risk assessment should consider whether others participating in the same activity are also at risk and whether the activity can safely resume. 16. Risk factors associated with exercise-related collapse can be personal, environmental, or external and recognised risk factors are listed below, noting this is not an exhaustive list: a. Personal risk factors include: • Dehydration. • Recent or current illness (include raised temperature). • Recent vaccination (within 24 hours). • Poor baseline conditioning/fitness level. • Excess body fat. • Prior poor fitness test performance. • Prior exercise related collapse. • Accumulated fatigue. • An underlying cardiac condition. • Asthma. • Sickle Cell Trait (SCT). Clinical evidence suggests that these individuals may be more prone to injury (or death) with physical exertion. b. Environmental and external risk factors include: • Lack of appropriate environmental acclimatisation (including heat, cold and altitude). • Exercise at altitude. • High ambient temperature and humidity and cold weather. • Certain medications. • Dietary supplements containing stimulants, including energy shots or drinks. 17. In addition, an individual’s motivation and /or peer, or command pressure (whether actual or self-induced) is equally important to recognise as a risk factor. With an individual pushing themselves during physical activity and ignoring the onset of physical signs and symptoms of distress. 18. Immediate Actions. In the event of exertional collapse, the following immediate action drills are to be followed: a. STOP the activity. b. EVALUATE, ADMINISTER FIRST AID as appropriate (i.e. Check Airway, Breathing, Circulation and TREAT as required) and CALL emergency services if needed (civilian and / or military in accordance with the Risk Assessment and situation)""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, page 32: ""c. ADMINISTER oxygen if available and appropriate. d. HYDRATE if tolerating liquids. e. INITIATE COOLING techniques as required. f. ENSURE appropriate medical follow-up of the individual. g. REVIEW others. Only restart the activity when assessed as safe to do so. If a suspected case is observed the activity must be paused and a dynamic risk assessment made. The activity may be terminated or only restarted once further mitigation measures have been approved, recorded, and applied as per the activity protocols. h. INFORM the chain of command as necessary. UNIVERSAL TRAINING PRECAUTIONS (UTPs) 19. The risk of Exertional Collapse can be reduced through Universal Training Precautions (UTPs). These UTPs should be integrated into the planning, design and conduct of fitness tests or other physical activity. They should also be included in an individual’s own preparation. 20. The UTPs are as follows: a. Acclimatisation to heat, cold or altitude. b. Progressive and graduated increase in exercise duration and intensity. c. Hydration sufficient to maintain clear-light yellow urine. d. Avoid stimulants, diuretics, energy drinks, antihistamines, decongestants, non-  steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, methylphenidate and weight-loss or other performance-enhancing supplements prior to exercise. e. Avoid alcohol prior to exercise. f. Ensure work /rest cycles are followed. g. Observe participants for no less than 10 minutes post exertion. h. Ensure medical facilities are available throughout any programmed physical activity and provide prompt medical attention when early signs of distress are observed. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPT-OUT 21. Illness and other personal risk factors outlined in paragraph 14 can increase the risk of exertional collapse, and it is recognised that there may be times when an individual is well enough to conduct many of their work duties whilst not feeling well enough to take part in physical activity. Personnel are not to take part in physical activity of any nature where,  having been briefed on the nature of the activity by the chain of command, they do not feel sufficiently well enough to take part, and should inform the activity owner if this is the case. The physical activity opt-out policy relates to both physical training sessions and broader military training or tasks involving physical activity64. Units must ensure that those instructing or leading physical Training, or other military training activities involving physical activity, are aware of this policy as an exertional collapse mitigation measure.

The person carrying out the hazard identification should have a good understanding of the activity, or process that is being assessed and should carry out this hazard identification in consultation with the personnel taking part in the activity. 18. Note that vibration exposure levels can be below the Exposure Action Values (EAV) and still pose a risk. Specifically, where the vibration exposure levels are likely to reach or exceed Exposure Action Value (EAV) then the same underlying principle applies: to reduce exposure to ALARP and tolerable. This would include a programme of organisational and technical measures. 19. The actions to be taken must be based on the general principles of prevention set out in Schedule 1 to The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, incorporating consideration of the relevant factors defined in the Legislation. The principles include: a. avoiding risks; b. evaluating the risks which cannot be avoided; c. combating the risks at source; d. adapting the work to the individual, especially with regards to the design of workplaces, the choice of work equipment and the choice of working and production methods, with a view, in particular, to alleviating monotonous work and work at a predetermined work-rate and to reducing their effect on health; e. adapting to technical progress; f. replacing the hazardous with the non-hazardous or the less hazardous; g. developing a coherent overall prevention policy which covers technology, organisation of work, working conditions, social relationships and the influence of factors relating to the working environment; h. giving collective protective measures priority over individual protective measures; and i. giving appropriate instructions to employees. Policy Statement 2 (Step 2 - Decide who may be harmed by the Vibration hazard). The commander, manager or accountable person must identify who may be at risk from exposure to harmful vibration levels or where people are exposed to vibration levels above the relevant Exposure Action Value (EAV). 20. The commander, manager or accountable person must identify who might be at risk from exposure to harmful vibration levels associated with the activity, and at the earliest opportunity provide those personnel with suitable and sufficient information and instruction. 21. It is recognised that the vibration exposure to personnel during military activities may be substantially different and more difficult to manage compared to the vibration exposure of civilians undertaking non-military activities. It is further recognised that national security may require exceptional cases to be made. This is addressed in more detail in the Defence exemption section of this chapter.""  ', '']"

This support includes specialist advice and guidance, as well as other adjustments where feasible and reasonable within Service and resource constraints. Soldiers may use Learning Credits for additional personal support or to provide specialist equipment specifically to help develop workplace coping strategies. SpLD Advisors are available to provide advice and support to soldiers when asked by their Chain of Command. The recognized Defence test for dyslexia is the Dyslexia Adult Screening Test (DAST), and soldiers may also investigate the applicability of other tools. Funding for specialist assessment may be provided, and soldiers can use Enhanced Learning Credits or Standard Learning Credits for additional personal support or specialized software or equipment.

The sentencing guidelines for a sailor found guilty of being AWOL are not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it does mention that Disciplinary Award of AWOL cannot be used if the Service person is not found guilty of AWOL or Desertion as this would have a negative effect on pay, allowances, charges and career management. Therefore, the specific sentencing guidelines for a sailor found guilty of being AWOL are not available in the provided reference text","['This passage is from JSP 760 Part 1.pdf, page 105: ""b. The Service person returns to duty and an end date is entered on JPA. Disciplinary proceedings may then follow resulting in Disciplinary Award of Absence Without Leave (see paras 17.16 - 17.19 below). c. It is ascertained that the Service person has apparently absented themselves. The absence is to be reported using T-SL-AD0282 and the Service person is to be moved to Long-Term Absentee (see paras 17.20 - 17.23) following a Board of Inquiry. Disciplinary Award of Absence without Leave (AWOL) 17.16. Disciplinary Award of AWOL is an absence type which can be selected and implemented retrospectively, by the Unit HR Administration staff only, to cover the period that a Service person has been away from their place of duty without the appropriate authorisation. The decision on what is deemed to be ‘appropriate authorisation’ falls to the discretion of the Service person’s CO. 17.17. Disciplinary Award of AWOL can be selected only when a Service person has returned to duty following a period of Unauthorised Absence irrespective of whether that return to duty has been voluntary or involuntary. The Service person must then be found guilty of an offence of AWOL or Desertion83 before a Disciplinary Award AWOL is selected. 17.18. Disciplinary Award of AWOL cannot be used if the Service person is not found guilty of AWOL or Desertion as this would have a negative effect on pay, allowances, charges and career management. 17.19. If the Service person is not found guilty of the offence of AWOL - typically because the Chain of Command is satisfied that there are extenuating circumstances relating to the absence then Authorised Absence (refer to Chapter 2) may be used if no other absence type is deemed to be more appropriate. If the CO is satisfied that the conduct of the Service person amounts to an offence of AWOL or Desertion but does not take disciplinary action the CO is to make an order of Forfeiture of Pay84 and the absence status should remain as Unauthorised Absence. Long Term Absentee 17.20. Long Term Absentee is the category to be used when a Service person is shown under Unauthorised Absence and there is no reasonable expectation that they will report for duty in the foreseeable future. The selection of this type of absence will ensure that correct career, pay, allowances and charges actions are taken. 17.21. The Service person’s CO will carry out investigations in accordance with single Service regulations to ascertain if there is a reasonable expectation that the Service person will return. If, in the opinion of the CO, there is little expectation of this then the individual should be shown as Long Term Absentee from the first day of the absence.

The exemptions apply to vehicles belonging to or being used for the purposes of Her Majesty's forces, including green fleet, white fleet, grey fleet Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Marine vehicles, as well as private vehicles authorised for duty journeys (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 23.pdf, page 1, paragraphs 2 and 3). Therefore, service personnel are exempt from toll charges when they are using a vehicle that belongs to Her Majesty's forces or when they are authorized to use a private vehicle for duty journeys (JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 23.pdf, page 1, paragraph 3b).

The detailed guidance on how these exemptions are applied and operated by the Services is provided in the JSP4. 6. In any situation where it is contended that an exemption should have applied or where there is an instance of an automatic exemption not being applied, it will be necessary for the driver concerned to pay the relevant toll or charges as necessary and subsequently reclaim them (see paragraph 7 below). 7.

Section 349 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 (the Act) provides that, in certain circumstances, vehicles from any of Her Majesty’s forces (regular and reserve forces) are exempt from tolls and charges. This chapter describes those circumstances. 2. Scope of exemptions. The tolls and charges from which exemption is given are those only in the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man which fall into the following categories: a. Any toll or charge levied for passing over a road, bridge or through a tunnel, e.g. M6 Toll Road, Dartford Crossing or Mersey Tunnel; or b. Any scheme which imposes charges for keeping or using a vehicle on particular roads, e.g. London congestion charge. This provision does not exempt civilian pattern livery MOD vehicles from displaying a road fund licence. However, green fleet1 vehicles with a valid FMT1001 should be exempt from displaying a road fund licence. 3. Application of section 349 of the Act. The vehicles to which section 349 applies are those that belong to, or are being used for the purposes of any of Her Majesty’s forces and accordingly, the following situations fall within the Act: a. Vehicles belonging to Her Majesty’s forces. The passage of any green fleet, white fleet or grey fleet2 Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Marine vehicle (including those belonging to the reserve forces) along any road, bridge or tunnel in the United Kingdom or Isle of Man where a toll or charge is ordinarily payable. The exemptions apply at all times that such vehicles are being driven because neither white/grey nor green fleet vehicles should be used unless authority has been given to do so and moreover, any such use should only be for an official, authorised journey. Accordingly, the exemptions also apply regardless of whether or not the vehicle in question is being driven by a member of Her Majesty’s forces; however, the vehicle must be under the control of the armed forces. b. Vehicles used for the purposes of Her Majesty’s forces. The passage of any vehicle not belonging to Her Majesty’s forces, but which is being used for the purposes of Her Majesty’s forces (including the reserve forces), along any road, bridge or tunnel where a toll or charge is ordinarily payable. Therefore, the exemptions apply to any person driving a private vehicle (including a hire vehicle), provided that he is authorised to use it for a duty for the purposes of Her Majesty’s forces and is so using it at the time of the toll/charge being levied. 4. Unauthorised use of vehicles. The use of green, white or grey fleet vehicles by Service personnel without authorisation, i.e. either using the vehicle without the proper authority or deviating from an authorised route in such a vehicle (e.g. taking a vehicle home 1 ‘Green fleet’ refers to operational military vehicles which are usually painted in operational colours – e.g. green or desert""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 464 Vol 3 Part 1.pdf, page 15: ""charges if living arrangements are deemed by the CO to satisfy field or shipboard conditions criteria; k.

A live link is any arrangement by which a person who is not in the place where the proceedings are being held is able to see and hear, and be seen and heard by, the court during proceedings. Military Court Centres within the UK and Germany and the Offices of the JAG are equipped with modern live link facilities. In addition, the armed forces have access to video telephone conference (VTC) facilities in many other locations, as do some civilian court centres. The widest use of VTC facilities, within the rules and guidance and in such a way as best supports the administration of justice, should be made wherever appropriate but at the discretion of the judge advocate. For the purpose of live links, the place at which the proceedings are being held is the place in which the judge advocate is located. 29. Application for a live link. A judge advocate may give a live link direction either on the application of a party to the proceedings or of his own motion33. Such an application may be made either in the proceedings or, where the proceedings are trial or appellate proceedings, in any related preliminary proceedings. Such an application may be made in writing, and should be made in writing if it is an application to attend preliminary proceedings by live link or if the subject matter of the live link direction is to be considered during any preliminary proceedings using the application for leave to adduce evidence through television link form (T-SL-CM01) at Annex A. When made during proceedings the application may be made orally, but the judge advocate may require written submissions""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 29.pdf, page 11: "". In addition, the judge advocate may require a specified person to be present with the witness giving evidence by live link to answer under oath any questions relating to the circumstances in which the evidence is given. 33. Defendant giving evidence during trial. A defendant may make an application to a judge advocate to give evidence at trial through a live link, and a direction may be made if it is in the interests of justice to do so. When deciding whether to make such a direction a judge advocate may wish to consider (but is not limited to) such factors as: the defendant’s age; any compromise to his ability to participate effectively in the proceedings due to his level of intellectual ability, social functioning or any mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983; and whether use of a live link would enable him to participate more effectively in the proceedings as a witness. 34. Special measures. Live links may be used in conjunction with or as part of a special measures direction35 (eg. witness gives evidence by live link, and in private, or judge advocate and counsel remove wigs and gowns), see paragraphs 88 to 89.

', 'This passage is from JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 29.pdf, page 11: ""30. Preliminary proceedings. Preliminary proceedings may be conducted using a live link if the judge advocate so directs. The judge advocate may decide whether to give a live link direction for subsequent CM proceedings at a preliminary hearing. The defendant, the defendant’s legal representative, the prosecutor, any witness required at the preliminary hearing, any interpreter or the CAO may be treated as present at a preliminary hearing by live link if the judge advocate so directs. 31. Defendant/offender attending a sentencing or activation hearing. The defendant/offender should usually attend at the place at which a hearing in relation to sentencing, including activation proceedings, is being held. However, circumstances may arise in which this is not possible, and in those circumstances the judge advocate may give a live link direction requiring the defendant/offender to attend the hearing (or any number of sentencing hearings) by live link. The consent of the defendant/offender is not required, but may be a relevant consideration for the judge advocate when determining whether to make the direction. The judge advocate may be more likely to give such a direction if it is likely that the defendant/offender will be held in Service custody during any sentencing or activation hearing, or otherwise not be in the place where the hearing is being held. The direction will not be given unless the judge advocate is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to give the direction. In addition, if the defendant/offender wishes to give oral evidence at the proceedings to which a potential live link direction applies, the judge advocate may wish to know the defendant/offender’s views as to whether he can effectively give evidence through the live link. A judge advocate may rescind the direction at any time, including during the hearing in relation to which it was given, if it is in the interests of justice to do so, but this does not prevent him from making a further live link direction in relation to the defendant/offender. If a judge advocate refuses an application for a live link for the defendant/offender’s attendance at a sentencing or activation hearing, or for rescinding such a direction, he should give his reasons for doing so. 32. Witnesses giving evidence by live link. A live link direction may be made in relation to any witness, whether as to fact, character or otherwise, and whether the witness is in the country in which the proceedings are being held or otherwise. Where a direction is given that a witness (including a defendant) may attend proceedings by live link, the witness cannot give evidence otherwise than by live link without the leave of the judge advocate34. In addition, the judge advocate may require a specified person to be present with the witness giving evidence by live link to answer under oath any questions relating to the circumstances in which the evidence is given. 33.

The time and place of the hearing will be determined after consultation with the Office of the Judge Advocate General. Live link 72. Custody hearings may be conducted by live link92. Such a live link will usually be a television link, but may be by telephone or similar e.g. IP, as long as the judge advocate, the accused and the CO (or their legal representatives), any interpreter and any witness giving evidence can both hear and be heard by one another. 73. In addition to this general ability to conduct custody hearings by live link, witnesses may with the permission of the judge advocate give evidence through a live link where it is not reasonably practicable for the witness to attend the hearing or if it is in the interests of justice93. An application for permission for a witness to give evidence by live link must be made by the person wishing to call them as soon as they believe that the person is likely to be able to give material evidence and it is not reasonably practicable for the witness to attend the hearing94. The application must be made in writing, copied to the CO or the person to whom the proceedings relate95. The application must be served on the CAO and state: a. The grounds of the application; b. The name and, where applicable, the Service number, rank or rate and unit of the witness; c. Where the witness is under 18, the date of birth of the witness; d. The country and place from where the witness will be giving evidence; and e. The name, occupation and relationship to the witness of any person proposed to accompany the witness and the grounds for believing that person should accompany the witness whilst giving evidence. 74. The judge advocate must not decide whether the application should be granted without first giving the opposing party (CO or accused as the case may be) an opportunity to make representations about the application96, and may give permission for the live link subject to conditions such as to place of giving evidence and presence of anyone with the witness when giving evidence97.

(Paragraphs 11a-c, JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 3.pdf, page 6). Additionally, any person who is recalled for service under the authority of a recall order made under the Reserve Forces Act 1966 or an officer recall obligation is regarded as a member of the regular forces from the time they are accepted into permanent service following their recall until they are discharged or released from that service and therefore subject to Service law at all times during this period of recall.

In addition, members of the reserve forces may be tried for certain offences under Part X of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 even though not subject to Service law at the time. 12. A reservist undertaking service under any of paragraph 11a – c and e above will be subject to Service law during the whole period of that service whether they is travelling, physically working, resting or off duty. This is different in respect of duties undertaken under paragraph 11d above (this is likely to be most relevant to members of volunteer reserve forces attending short periods of training or duty). Broadly speaking, such a person will be subject to Service law while they are with their reserve force. So, for example, where they attends an 8 hour training period on a Saturday they will be subject to Service law during the time of the training period only and not when they is driving to the period or returning home from it. Staff legal advice should be obtained if there is any doubt as to whether a reservist was subject to Service law at the time they committed the alleged offence. 13. Recall. Any person who is recalled for service under the authority of a recall order made under the Reserve Forces Act 1996, or under an officer recall obligation, is for the purposes of the Act, regarded as being a member of the regular forces from the time that they is accepted into permanent service following their recall until they is discharged or released from that service.13 Accordingly, such persons will be subject to Service law at all times during this period of recall in the same way that Service law applies to the regular forces as described above. In addition, they may be tried by the CM for certain offences under Part X of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 even though not accepted into service at the time of the alleged offence. 14. British overseas territories’ forces14 . When any member of a British overseas territory force, i.e. any of Her Majesty’s forces raised under the law of a British overseas territory, is undertaking any duty or training with United Kingdom regular or reserve forces, they becomes subject to Service law15 for the duration of the training or duty. They are treated for the purposes of the Act as having an equivalent rank or rate to a relative member of the force with which they is serving. To this extent, any member of a British overseas territory force who is serving with Her Majesty’s forces also has like powers of command over the United Kingdom forces with which they is serving16 . 15.

This chapter sets out who may be subject to Service jurisdiction and who may exercise it. Although the avoidance of unnecessary delay is a key driver for all involved in the administration of discipline in the Services, the Armed Forces Act 2006 (the Act) does not generally contain formal time limits on the charging of persons as long as they remain subject to Service law or subject to Service discipline. Time limits are a concern, however, in relation to reservists, those who have left the regular or reserve forces and civilians who have ceased to be subject to Service discipline. Persons subject to Service law or Service discipline 2. The Act applies to two categories of persons; persons subject to Service law (both Service personnel1 and ex-Service personnel) and civilians subject to Service discipline (relevant civilians). Members of the regular forces2 are persons subject to Service law at all times and anywhere in the world. Reservists are subject to Service law only in the circumstances set out and explained in paragraphs 10 to 13 below. Forces of the British overseas territories are only subject to Service law when they are serving with Her Majesty’s forces. Persons will become civilians subject to Service discipline only in certain limited circumstances; see paragraphs 17 to 27 below. 3. Persons who fall into either of the two categories above who are alleged to have committed a Service offence3 may be investigated. If charged, a person subject to Service law may be brought before their commanding officer (CO) at summary hearing (for certain offences) or before the Court Martial (CM). A CO cannot hear a charge against a civilian subject to Service discipline; relevant civilians may only be brought before the Service Civilian Court (SCC) or be tried before the CM. 4. Any person subject to Service law or Service discipline may be tried before the CM. This may be because the charge faced is serious enough to justify or require it, or because the facts or the law in the case are so complex. Even if none of these factors is present, any person subject to Service law (who would otherwise be tried at a summary hearing) or a civilian subject to Service discipline (who would otherwise be tried before the SCC) may elect CM trial. Concurrent jurisdiction 5. In many cases there may be concurrent jurisdiction; this means that cases could be investigated or prosecuted by Service, UK civilian or foreign authorities. Decisions on who exercises jurisdiction will have to take into account the principles contained in relevant protocols, in Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) or in memoranda of understanding (MOU); decisions involving foreign authorities will require prior consultation with the appropriate Service authorities4 .

126,How do I make an appeal after being found guilty by a court martial?,"To make an appeal after being found guilty by a court martial, you should obtain legal advice from your representative as soon as possible (JSP 838, paragraph 145). If the representative advises you to appeal, legal aid funding for preparing an Application for Leave to Appeal is automatically available if you had legal aid for the trial (JSP 838, paragraph 145). You should then submit this application to the Court Martial Appeal Court (CMAC) (JSP 838, paragraph 146). If the CMAC grants the appeal, they will assume responsibility for all associated legal aid funding requests thereafter. If the initial Application for Leave to Appeal is not granted, any subsequent applications are a matter between you and your representative, and neither the Armed Forces Legal Aid Scheme nor the CMAC will provide any legal aid funding for this work (JSP 838, paragraphs 146 and 147).

A convicted offender who pleaded, or was found, guilty of some or all charges, may wish to seek leave to appeal against the outcome at the Court Martial Appeal Court (CMAC). Before taking any further action, the convicted offender should obtain legal advice from their representative. 145. Advice supporting an appeal. Should the representative(s) involved in the case advise their client to appeal, legal aid funding for the preparation of an Application for Leave to Appeal (Form 1) is automatically available; where the offender had legal aid for the trial39, there is no need to re-apply for legal aid at this stage, unless the offender is also requesting a different legal representative (see paragraph 147, below). 146. The CMAC decision. The CMAC will consider the application and, if the appeal is allowed, the CMAC will assume responsibility for all associated legal aid funding requests thereafter.

The same applies when a Service person or relevant civilian aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of a criminal offence by another person; Section 4287 applies to those who aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a criminal offence in the same way as to the principal offender. Whilst it is proper to charge an accessory as if he were a principal offender, it may sometimes be more appropriate to charge them as an accessory (e.g. when it is clear at the outset that he did not actually commit the offence themselves). The words aid, abet counsel and procure may all be used together to charge a person who is alleged to have participated in the offence in some way, but not as the principal offender. 105. By contrast, if a Service person encourages or assists another person to commit any offence, they are guilty not of the main offence, but of the separate offence of encouraging or assisting. If the encouraging or assisting is to commit criminal conduct which would be an offence under the law of England and Wales, the encouraging or assisting will be an offence under section 42 of the Act. If the encouraging or assisting is to commit an offence under the Act (other than a criminal conduct offence)88, the relevant offence will be under section 40 of the Act. For example, if A encourages or assists B to make a false record (contrary to section 18 of the Act), B should be charged with an offence under section 40, as A did not themselves make the false record. 106. Specimen charges for involvement as a secondary party under section 41 of the Act are set out in Chapter 7 (Non-criminal conduct (disciplinary) offences) and specimen charges for aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring are set out in Chapter 8 (Criminal conduct offences). 107. Charging procedure. Once the charge sheet has been raised, the CO should proceed to charge the suspect. The procedure set out below must be followed: a. The CO (or a subordinate commander) must sign89 the charge sheet (ie. the person who it is intended is to hear the charge); and b. A copy of the signed charge sheet must be served by hand90 on the accused. Service of a charge can be carried out by the CO, or by anyone authorised91 by the CO. The charge sheet should also be signed and dated when service is carried out. 108""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 7.pdf, page 127: "". The elements of encouragement, or of threats or other pressure, may be implied by an accused as well as stated expressly. For example a defendant may strongly imply that if the other person does not commit an offence they may ‘suffer for it’. A person can in fact be assisted without being aware of the act of assistance.

Your wellbeing at all stages of the Service Complaints system is important. In addition to support and advice provided by your Chain of Command (CoC), a range of independent support is available (see Annex Q) for further information. An Easy Read Guide providing a short summary of the Service Complaints process and what you can expect from it is also available. 3. It is the responsibility of all involved in the process to ensure complaints are handled confidentially, fairly, promptly and correctly. But it is important to note that if you do not engage in the investigation in a timely manner, the decision on a Service Complaint can be made on the basis of the evidence available. 4, This responsibility extends to Complainants, Respondents and all other persons involved in handling a Service Complaint, ensuring that they cooperate fully within the prescribed time limits, and in good faith, at all times. 5. The intent is that Service Complaints are dealt with at the lowest appropriate level possible and resolution achieved quickly. Where appropriate, with every effort being made to resolve a complaint informally at any stage.

132,What types of supplements can I use?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 835.pdf, there are two main categories of supplements mentioned: dietary supplements and drugs. Dietary supplements contribute to the nutritional needs of the body by providing significant amounts of essential nutrients, while drugs do not contribute significantly to nutritional needs and are consumed in microgram doses. Dietary supplements may include products like fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks, protein shakes, and other products that provide additional energy and essential nutrients (JSP 835.pdf, p. 41). However, it is important to note that not all dietary supplements are created equal, and some may be contaminated with drugs or prohibited substances. To reduce the risk of a positive Compulsory Drug Test (CDT) and ensure purity, it is recommended to source supplements from reputable manufacturers with rigorous quality assurance programs, such as those participating in the Informed-Sport program (JSP 835.pdf, p. 42).

Therefore, the answer to your question is that you can use dietary supplements that are responsibly sourced and used as directed. It is important to avoid using drugs or supplements containing drugs, as they are forbidden by Service law and may result in a positive CDT and disciplinary action (JSP 835.pdf, p. 40).

Citation: JSP 835.pdf, pages 40-42","['This passage is from JSP 835.pdf, page 40: ""ANNEX D TO CHAPTER 4 TO JSP 835 SUPPLEMENT USE BY UK DEFENCE PERSONNEL Current issues 1. Recent studies1 suggest the use of supplements by members of the UK Armed Forces is widespread, and includes trainees, UK-based troops and those preparing to deploy, as well as personnel in operational theatres. Whilst the use of some supplements in certain circumstances can have positive effects, their misuse can have detrimental effects on the health of individuals and could lead to a positive Compulsory Drug Test (CDT) outcome. What are supplements? 2. The term supplement is used to describe a wide range of products ingested by individuals who desire a range of physiological and/or psychological effects from the provision of additional nutrients from the supplement. These nutrients may be absent from the normal daily diet, or may not be consumed in sufficient amounts to achieve ergogenic (performance enhancing) effects. Supplement products often claim to improve health and wellbeing and / or to sustain or improve some aspect of physical or mental performance. A number of products that are marketed as exercise or training supplements, actually contain drugs as part of their composition to increase their efficacy. These drugs include anabolic agents such as anabolic steroids, pro-hormones, peptide hormones and growth factors such as Erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, corticotrophins, and growth hormone. It is therefore important to distinguish between dietary supplements and drugs. 3. Dietary Supplements. Dietary supplements contribute to the nutritional needs of the body by providing significant amounts of carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, or trace elements, in a form that is readily used by the body. Fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks and protein shakes all fall into this category. Such products may not be generally needed in a normal military life style, but the taking of such dietary supplements is highly unlikely to lead to a positive CDT if they are responsibly sourced and used as directed. 4. Drugs. Drugs do not contribute significantly to the nutritional needs of the body and are consumed in microgram (μg) doses. Drugs exert a profound effect on the body and are able to produce significant gains in performance. EPO, anabolic steroids and growth 1 Boos CJ., Wheble GA., Campbell MJ., Tabner KC. and Woods DR.

Losses of body mass in the region of 6 – 10% or higher have been shown to impair performance in a military setting, although this is not a consistent observation. 9. Dietary supplements should not be used to compensate for poor food choices and an inadequate diet where a choice exists, but dietary supplements that provide additional energy and / or essential nutrients may be useful when food intake or food choices are restricted for reasons including operational constraints, travel, and periods when preparation and / or consumption of adequate meals is not possible or desirable. The use of dietary supplements in such instances would reduce the risk of developing nutrient deficiencies that could impair both health and performance. 2 HFL Sport Science is an independent drug surveillance laboratory owned by LGC.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 835.pdf, page 42: ""10. A small number of dietary supplements may enhance performance when used in accordance with current evidence under the guidance of a well-informed professional,3 and / or using MOD approved supporting guidance written by experts in the area. Suitable professionals include registered nutritionists, registered dieticians, and other professionals with recognised expertise in performance-related nutrition. Service personnel contemplating the use of dietary supplements should consider their efficacy, their cost, the risk to health and performance, and the potential for a positive CDT. The use of multiple dietary supplements at one time (stacking) should be discouraged. Dietary supplement use by children (i.e. individuals under 18 years of age) should also be discouraged. Information 11. The Defence Nutrition Working Group is examining issues regarding supplement use and misuse by UK military personnel. While current advice from the Defence Nutrition Advisory Service (DNAS) is that it is not necessary for any members of the UK military to take dietary supplements as the necessary energy and nutrient intake can be obtained from eating a regular and balanced diet, supporting guidance on the use of dietary supplements is being prepared for Service personnel who wish to consume them. 3 IOC Consensus Statement on Sports Nutrition, Lausanne Oct 2010.  Chapter 5 – Compulsory Drug Testing (CDT) – Policy and Administration Aim 1. The aim of the CDT programme is to provide an effective deterrent capability, in the most cost-effective manner, in support of the Armed Forces’ wider measures to prevent drug misuse within the Services. Each Service conducts its own CDT programme of testing. The most common and accurate method of establishing the presence of controlled drugs in an individual is by the chemical analysis of urine, which is the recognised world standard, and this is, therefore, the testing method. It also has the advantage of being a ‘non-""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 835.pdf, page 41: ""hormones are drugs. The taking of drugs is forbidden by Service law and service personnel taking drugs are highly likely to test positive at CDT, which will lead to disciplinary action. 5. Contamination. Dietary supplements may become contaminated with drugs, either deliberately by unscrupulous manufacturers seeking to enhance the efficacy of the product to support their marketing claims, or by inadvertent cross contamination during manufacture. Contamination of supplements with drugs, including anabolic steroids and pro-hormones, is a real issue facing personnel contemplating the use of supplements. The taking of contaminated dietary supplements may result in a positive CDT and subsequent administrative and / or disciplinary action. Servicemen and women contemplating the use of dietary supplements must take the utmost care to avoid taking contaminated products. Sourcing Supplements 6. It is not possible to guarantee that specific supplements will be free of contaminants and prohibited substances but it may be possible to reduce the risk of a positive CDT by making informed decisions. Nutritional supplements manufactured by pharmaceutical companies using pharmaceutical grade ingredients and employing quality assurance programmes are more likely to be free of contamination than those manufactured by sports nutrition companies with less rigorous quality assurance. However, sourcing supplements from pharmaceutical companies still offers no guarantee of purity. 7. In the UK, the HFL Sports Science2 owned “Informed-Sport programme” was set up with the support of UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) to evaluate the process integrity of supplement manufacturers and to screen supplements and ingredients for contamination. Products that have passed this screening process can be found at www.informed-sport.com/. POSITION Use of dietary supplements by UK Service personnel 8. Energy requirements depend on an individual’s level of physical activity and will vary from day to day, and from task to task. A diet that provides adequate energy from a wide range of foods can meet the carbohydrate, protein, fat and micronutrient requirements of physical training and operations. Food provided by the MOD is scientifically researched and designed to provide the daily dietary intake required to sustain service personnel in all military environments. There is evidence that soldiers predominantly dependant on Operational Ration Packs (ORP) supplemented by limited quantities of frozen meat and fresh vegetables, in the harsh operational environment of Sangin, suffered no degradation in physical performance over the 6 month period of the deployment. In general, short-term energy restriction involving minimal loss of body mass has little effect on performance or health in otherwise healthy individuals. Losses of body mass in the region of 6 – 10% or higher have been shown to impair performance in a military setting, although this is not a consistent observation. 9""  ', '']"

Access to justice. The importance of access to justice for all and the right to legal representation has long been recognised in the UK. To support these principles, a formal legal aid scheme was established to provide publicly funded legal representation e.g. to defend against criminal charges in the magistrates’ and Crown Courts, for those who would otherwise be denied access to justice because they could not afford to pay for it. 2. The underpinning principles. The legal aid scheme is underpinned by the basic principle that those who can afford to pay some or all of their defence costs should do so, whereas those who cannot afford to contribute should receive legal aid support free of charge. Applying this basic principle enables public funds to be used to assist as many people as possible whilst also providing value for money for the taxpayer. As part of this tenet, it follows that, ultimately, the contribution paid by any convicted offender is limited to either their maximum contribution (based upon their personal and financial circumstances at the time of application1) or their actually legally aided costs, whichever is the lower; the maximum contribution includes the full pre-trial income contribution plus any post-trial capital/equity contribution. These principles remain as relevant today as when the first legal aid schemes were established in the UK in 19492. 3. The Armed Forces Legal Aid Scheme (AFLAS). Although non-""  ', '']"

135,"As a commanding officer, what do I have to do for the victims of crime?","According to JSP 839.pdf, as a commanding officer, you are required to provide services to victims of crime committed by a suspect under your command (JSP 839.pdf, page 2, Section 3.1). At first contact with the victim, you must provide certain information without unnecessary delay, including contact details for the person taking their complaint, a reference number, and a brief summary of the incident they have reported (JSP 839.pdf, page 2, Section 3.2). You should also offer immediate support to the victim by making them aware of the range of immediate sources of support, both professional and Service Welfare organizations (JSP 839.pdf, page 16, Step 3). Additionally, if the incident involves a sexual offense or other serious crime, you must ensure that the victim is provided with appropriate support and handle the case in accordance with procedures laid down in the Manual of Service Law (JSP 839.pdf, page 16, Overview). If you are unsure of the procedures to follow, you should contact the relevant Service discipline/legal branch for advice (JSP 839.pdf, page 16, Step 2).

This guidance is written specifically for you, in your role as a Commanding Officer, to assist you in the care and management of personnel who have been the victim of the most serious crime, or who are considered to be persistently targeted, vulnerable or intimidated victims. This guidance aims to set out for you, step-by-step, the actions you must take, and the issues you must consider, where such allegations have been made. It also contains specific guidance for cases where a victim and alleged offender are in the same unit. 2. Managing incidents involving violence and/or a sexual element can be difficult, even for those who are trained to do so. There are two primary objectives, for the Commanding Officer, in such cases. First, you must ensure that the victim is provided with appropriate support. The incident may have happened very recently or perhaps some time ago but all victims are to be managed professionally, respectfully and sensitively regardless of any time lapse between the incident and the reporting of it. Secondly, all cases are to be handled in accordance with procedures laid down in the Manual of Service Law (volume 1, chapter 6). If you are in any doubt as to the procedures to be followed, you should contact the relevant Service discipline/legal branch for advice. 3. When an incident is reported to you, there are a number of issues you will need to consider. The steps below should be followed: a. Step 1. Offer immediate reassurance. When you see the victim it is important to remain calm, impartial and reassuring, and make clear to them that your immediate focus is on their safety and well-being. Where the complaint concerns a sexual offence, it may be appropriate to acknowledge their courage in reporting the offence to you b. Step 2. Determine the category of the victim. Consider whether the person falls into any of the categories defined at Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Annex. If not, the procedures at Reference B should be followed. c. Step 3. Offer immediate support. You should let the person know the immediate steps you will take in dealing with the incident, including reporting to the Service Police if that is required (see Step 5). An initial priority is to make the victim aware of the range of immediate sources of support, both professional (e.g. NHS/SARCs (see below)) and Service Welfare organisations and/or Chaplaincy services. Alternatively, a person may simply request the support of a close colleague, or friend, while others may not want any support at all, at this stage. It is important that the individual is allowed to make their own choice and that there is a range of options available. d. Step 4. Preservation of evidence""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 839.pdf, page 2: ""SECTION 3 – COMMANDING OFFICERS 3.1 The Code requires COs to provide services to which the victim of a crime committed by a suspect under their command is entitled. The services to be provided by a CO will vary depending on whether the incident is being investigated by the Service Police or the CO. This Section provides guidance to COs on how these entitlements should be delivered. CO’s Investigation 3.2 First Contact. The Code requires you to provide certain information to the victim without unnecessary delay from your first contact with them. This should generally be provided at first contact7. This is detailed within the introduction to the Code at Part 1, Chapter 3, Paragraph 13 to the Code. First contact is defined as being the first meeting that you have with the victim. Whilst it is acknowledged that this first contact may actually be conducted by somebody acting on your behalf, the obligation is on you as the CO to ensure that the information is provided. All of the information that must be provided to a victim at first contact is contained within the ‘Victim of Crime’ leaflet at Annex C. This includes the provision of contact details for the person taking their compliant, a reference number and brief summary of the incident they have reported. Actions/Guidance. a. The Victim of Crime leaflet must be completed and handed to a victim at first contact and the person handing over the leaflet should request that the victim reads it. b. They should then ask the victim whether they wish their details to be passed to Victim Support. If they do, ensure that their details are passed to the relevant victim support services – see Section 9 of this JSP. c. A written record should be made to document that the leaflet has been handed to and read by the victim, as well as any request for referral to Victim Support or if the offer was declined. d. Agree with the victim how often they wish to be updated on the progress of the case. 3.3 Interpretation and Translation. If the victim does not understand or speak English, they are entitled to request interpretation into a language they understand: a. when reporting a criminal offence; b. when being interviewed by the Service Police or Commanding Officer exercising powers of investigation; and c. when giving evidence as a witness. 7 If the first contact is not face to face, or if the relevant leaflets are not available at the time, the information must be provided without unnecessary delay thereafter.""

We do not underestimate the devastating impact that a sexual assault, or other serious crime, can have on a person. Please be assured that the MOD will handle your complaint with the utmost seriousness. You are bound to have additional concerns if the person who assaulted you is from your unit and the ways in which we can provide you with support in this type of situation, are included in the guidance below. In this guidance, we will not try to tell you what you should do or how you should react because there are no right or wrong ways, everyone will react differently to a traumatic experience. However, we do want to let you know what support is available within your Service and from other civilian organisations. Here are some of the issues you may need to think about as a result of your experience. If you find you need guidance on something which is not covered, please speak with your Victim Support Officer (VSO), Victim Liaison Officer (VLO) or alternatively contact your unit Welfare Officer, or other Service welfare provider, who will try to assist you further. 2. Deciding whether to report the incident and who to approach. The decision whether to report an incident may not be an easy one to take and we understand that, in some cases, people choose not to do so. There is nothing wrong in feeling that you would rather not make a report and this does not stop you from seeking specialist medical, emotional and trauma support directly from the non-Service organisations listed in Appendix 1. If this is how you are feeling, you are urged to continue reading this guidance and to seek the help that is available for you from non-Service sources, as soon as possible. 3. If you decide that you do want to make a complaint, so that it can be properly investigated, you can contact the Service Police, the Civil Police or your Commanding Officer (or, if you prefer, someone else in your chain of command). When you inform your Commanding Officer of your complaint, they will have to ensure that any offences are appropriately investigated. For certain serious offences your CO may have to ensure that the Service Police are made aware of the matter and they, in turn, will begin their official investigation as soon as possible. While you may also report any offence to another person within your chain of command, they too would have to investigate the complaint or report it to the CO or Service Police. So, if you would like your complaint to be properly investigated you should contact the Service, or Civil, Police, or your CO. However, if you feel that you do not want to do this, at least for the time being, you are still urged to seek immediate help from the non-Service sources that are detailed below. 4.

Defence is committed to ensuring that there is no discrimination against transgender applicants during the recruitment process. Defence encourages diversity in the workplace and welcomes applications to join the Regular and the Reserve Armed Forces from transgender people. Where those responsible for recruiting Armed Forces personnel become aware that an applicant is transgender, the application process should be followed using the applicant’s affirmed gender. 2. As Ground Close Combat roles (GCC) are now open to women, applications from transgender individuals to join these roles should be processed in the same way as any other application. Recruiters and those involved in the recruitment process must ensure that information that reveals that an applicant is transgender must be handled in a lawful manner. Further guidance and advice can be obtained from a single-Service lawyer. Information is also available in 2016DIN01-115: Women in Ground Close Combat – Lifting of Exclusions for Women in Ground Close Combat Roles across Defence. CONFIDENTIALITY 3. A transgender applicant is ordinarily under no obligation to reveal to a recruiter (or to anyone in the recruitment process) that they are transgender, or their gender history. However, this information may be revealed in the recruitment process through the production of official documentation, (e.g. academic qualifications, birth certificates etc) which indicate that the applicant’s affirmed gender is different to their acquired gender. Where information is received which reveals that an applicant is transgender (including any information which reveals that the person has applied for or is in possession of a Gender Recognition Certificate) care should be taken to ensure the information is not forwarded to others unless it is necessary to do so. Before any information is forwarded, the recruiter should seek the advice of a single-Service lawyer because in certain circumstances it is an offence to disclose information of this type to another. 4. Consideration should always be given as to whether the information received can be provided in a manner that removes all references to the applicant’s gender history. For example, if it is necessary to establish or confirm the academic qualifications held by an applicant, consideration should be given to whether the recruiter can formally record the detail of the applicant’s academic qualifications (grades/ subjects years taken etc.) rather than retaining or forwarding photocopies of certificates. 5. In certain circumstances it may be necessary for an applicant to reveal that they are transgender and for the information to be recorded and forwarded to others.

Robust Training is deliberately intended to challenge recruits and trainees as such there is an inherent risk of exceeding their existing/core physical and / or mental resilience and therefore appropriate measures are to be taken to monitor this risk and ameliorate its impact. 10.5 Governance 14. It is a requirement that training events that incorporate a robust element or that seek to achieve a greater level of resilience through the application of pressures (stated above) be appropriately governed. Commanders must therefore ensure appropriate governance procedures are in place and that such training is regularly scrutinised through 1st, 2nd and 3rd party assurance procedures. All Robust Training must be linked directly to a specified TO. TDAs must be aware of all Robust Training events that take place in their training establishments and ensure that they are appropriate and proportionate to the training outcome, controlled and fully integrated into the core syllabus, and delivered in an entirely transparent manner. 10.6 Training 15. Trainers and staff engaged in any aspect of Robust Training are to be suitably briefed as to the aim and desired outcomes of the training events, as well as supervised where appropriate. In addition, the Defence Centre for Training Support (DCTS) runs the Defence Trainer Capability and DSAT courses that all training staff, and most particularly those engaged in the design and delivery of Robust Training, need to attend. 10.7 Exertional Collapse, Universal Training Precautions (UTP) and Physical Activity Opt- Out Policy 16.

139,How are pension payments calculated under AFPS 15?,"The pension payments under AFPS 15 for a person are calculated using two components: the basic amount and the additional service allowance. The basic amount is equal to 34% of the provisional annual amount of the person’s deferred pension under AFPS 15 at the point of exit (JSP 905 Part 1, paragraphs 143.1-143.2). The additional service allowance is equal to 0.85% of the provisional amount of the person’s deferred pension under AFPS 15 for every full year served as a member of the Regular forces beyond the 20-year service and age 40 qualification point (JSP 905 Part 1, paragraphs 143.3). The lump sum payment is the provisional amount of the member’s deferred pension under AFPS 15, multiplied by 2.25 (JSP 905 Part 1, paragraph 143.4).

The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (AFPS 15) arose from this and was introduced on 1 April 2015. 1.2 Those serving personnel who were within ten years of their previous scheme’s Normal Pension Age on 1 April 2012 were granted Transitional Protection and were not eligible to transfer to AFPS 15, instead remaining in their existing pension scheme. 1.3 Those serving personnel who were not eligible for Transitional Protection and who transitioned direct from their legacy pension scheme into AFPS 15, or who re-joined on or after 1 April 2015 were granted protection of all pension benefits that had been earned under their legacy scheme. 1.4 Personnel who had left the Armed Forces prior to 1 April 2015, with either a pension in payment or a pension in deferment, retain their full pension rights from their legacy scheme. Establishment of Scheme 2.1 The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (AFPS 15) came into force on 1 April 15. The scheme is for the payment of pensions and benefits in respect of a person’s service in the Armed Forces. AFPS 15 was introduced under powers held by the Secretary of State under the Public Service Pensions Act and the Armed Forces Pension Regulations 2014.

For those described in paras 1125 (a) and 1126, any subsequent dependants’ benefits will be paid in accordance with normal AFPS 05 rules. So, for example, the spouse’s pension would be calculated by multiplying the member’s final pensionable earnings by the amount of reckonable service he was allowed to count, and the result multiplied by 1/112. However, it is understood that there is nobody within the scope of the AFPS 05 GOTT who falls into this category. 1128. For those described at para 1125 (b), their GPS pension will be replaced by EDP benefits. The amount of the pension which will come into payment when they reach age 65 will be calculated by the Scheme Actuary, taking into account the HMRC rule which does not allow the payment of a second pension commencement lump sum. The EDP will be calculated in the usual way (see Part 2 of this JSP). EDP payments will be backdated to the last day of service and arrears will be adjusted to take account of the amount of GPS pension already paid. 1129. For those described at para 1125 (b) and 1128, subsequent dependants’ benefits will be paid under AFPS 05 rules. 1130.

HMRC rules prevent the payment of a second pension commencement lump sum and, in the event that, after the Actuary’s calculations, one is due, a higher pension will be paid at age 65 on a permanent basis instead (see example at para 1123).

If a person, who was serving on a short term commitment (see para 0209), is made redundant, a CLS is to be paid to him on leaving.

The terms ‘Human Factors (HF)’, ‘Human Factors Engineering (HFE)’ and ‘Human Factors Integration’ are often confused. ‘Human Factors’ refers to a range of disciplines (principally scientific), which relate to the study of human capabilities, limitations, characteristics and behaviour in the broadest possible sense. It includes the study of human interactions with technologies and social interactions and draws on many scientific disciplines, including ergonomics, psychology (and neuropsychology), physiology, biology, anthropometry and biomechanics. It provides the knowledge base from which Human Factors Engineering draws. HFE is concerned with the application of this knowledge in the design, development, assessment, fielding, in-service support and disposal of products – equipment, sub-systems, systems and platforms. In contrast, HFI is a management activity, which includes a systematic process for identifying, tracking and resolving people-related considerations (especially risks and issues), to ensure a balanced development of both technological and human aspects of capability. 2. It is imperative to understand that HFI is more than HFE. It comprises the following five domains: a. Personnel. b. Training. c. Human Factors Engineering. d. System Safety & Health Hazards. e.

141,How do I integrate human factors into the design of a new piece of equipment?,"According to JSP 912 Part 1.pdf (page 5), Human Factors Integration (HFI) is a management activity that includes a systematic process for identifying, tracking, and resolving people-related considerations to ensure a balanced development of both technological and human aspects of capability. HFI encompasses five domains: personnel, training, Human Factors Engineering, system safety & health hazards, and social & organizational (JSP 912 Part 1.pdf, page 5). To integrate human factors into the design of a new piece of equipment, you should consider each of these domains and ensure that they are addressed throughout the design process.

For personnel concerns, understand the numbers and characteristics of the personnel who will operate, maintain, sustain, and provide training for the equipment. Inform design decisions to deliver a solution such that the personnel solution is deliverable and sustainable, and the through-life cost of the systems (taking into account both personnel and equipment costs) are optimized (JSP 912 Part 1.pdf, page 5).

For training, identify any necessary risk mitigation activities associated with the design and ensure that appropriate training is provided to enable effective use of the equipment in its military context (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 48).

For Human Factors Engineering, identify what Human Factors analyses have been applied during the design and development of the product and make any necessary modifications to ensure the item is fit for purpose in its military context (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 48).

For system safety & health hazards, identify risks and concerns associated with the design and necessary risk mitigation activities (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 48).

For social & organizational considerations, ensure that the integration of the People and Equipment Components is effective and that the operational, organizational, and management processes linking them are optimized (JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 9).

By considering each of these domains and addressing their requirements throughout the design process, you can effectively integrate human factors into the design of a new piece of equipment.

(4) identify what Human Factors analyses, if any, have been applied during the design and development of the product. 3. While there may be reduced HFI activities for NDIs and COTs/MOTs items as a result of research and design stages having been completed, additional focus may be required on the non-equipment DLODs such as personnel and training; this is due to the human component potentially having to adapt to optimise the use of the NDI/COTs/MOTs item. Modifications to Off-The-Shelf Equipment 4. The PT has a duty to ensure that equipment acquired Off The Shelf can be operated safely and effectively in a range of environments and against a range of threats. While there may be a need for some modifications to be made to such equipment prior to their acceptance into service, since they add cost and risk to what should otherwise be low-risk projects, these are to be kept to a minimum. 5. Off-The-Shelf procurements may be considered in terms of OTS products and OTS-  based Systems. There is a distinct difference between these two types of procurement. a. An OTS product may include a single OTS item or a defined configuration of separate OTS items sold as an integrated OTS system (the Solution Provider has already carried out the system design and its complexity is hidden from the Acquirer) where the MOD may be one of a number of purchasers. b. An OTS-based system on the other hand is one where the MOD seeks to develop a system based on a typically large number of OTS components in a configuration of its own design and particular requirements. Typically, each OTS component is bought separately and then integrated to form a new system configuration, never previously developed and unique to this application [16]. 6. The HFI process for OTS products will vary from those for OTS-based systems, this distinction should be understood when applying and tailoring the HFI Process. Although OTS products may involve little HFI activity during process stage HFI-4.0 (Detailed System Design), OTS -based systems may require significant HFI effort in this phase as although the system components are OTS the integration of these items is closer to a development item project.

The Solution should recognise and provide for human needs and use people in ways that maximise system safety (see [2] and [3]). Why Consider the Human Component of Capability? 6. Although many Defence Acquisition projects are concerned with the acquisition of technology (i.e. infrastructure, platforms, equipment, hardware, software), even in so-called uninhabited systems, such tangible items must be operated, maintained and supported by people. Thus, whatever their nature, degree of complexity or technological sophistication, systems that provide Defence Capability comprise: a. Infrastructure, equipment, hardware, software, information and material necessary to deliver the required capability (referred to collectively in this document as the ‘Equipment Component’) and; b. MOD Service personnel and Civilian support staff, together with the organisations and structures in which people work, (referred to in this document as the ‘Human Component’). 7. Failure to consider the Human Component of Capability can have many adverse consequences: increased risk of accidents and incidents; higher training costs; reduced performance and mission effectiveness; breaches in duty of care; scarcity of appropriately skilled personnel; delays to the project schedule and substantial increases in design / redesign costs. 8. To achieve the required capability, both of these components must work in close combination and harmony. The effectiveness and efficiency of the resulting system, or a constituent part, may depend critically on the Human Component and the adequacy of this combination. Of critical importance is that the People and Equipment Components must be effectively integrated together. 9.

Human-Centred Design is the approach that seeks to accommodate human needs within the design of technological products/systems [4]. HFI Domains 10. HFI involves the identification and trade-off of people-related considerations that could affect capability development and delivery. A framework of Five HFI domains is used: a. Personnel concerns both the numbers of people, (military and civilian), required and available to operate, maintain, sustain and provide training for systems, as well as their physical, cognitive, sensory and behavioural characteristics3. This Domain involves both: understanding the numbers and characteristics of the personnel required by the solution being developed; and informing design decisions to deliver a solution such that: the personnel solution is deliverable and sustainable, and the through life cost of the systems (taking into account both personnel and equipment costs) are optimised. This domain is key to optimising the integration of the People and Equipment DLODs to deliver an effective capability, not just an effective system""  ', '']"

This JSP sets out the technical governance and assurance framework to be applied as appropriate to Modelling & Simulation (M&S)1 across Defence. The role of the Defence Modelling and Simulation Coherence (DMaSC) Technical Authority (TA) is to promote Value for Money (VfM) at the Defence Enterprise level and build corporate knowledge supported by the Defence Simulation Centre (DSC)2. 2. This JSP applies to all uses of M&S. However, due to resource constraints, the initial focus of the DMaSC TA and the DSC will be primarily on training capabilities unless directed otherwise by the TA. 3. NATO defines M&S as the discipline that ‘develops and/or uses models, simulations and simulation systems’3. It is important to note that M&S is a term in itself and not the sum of the two words ‘modelling’ and ‘simulation’. 4. The NATO definitions of ‘model’ and ‘simulation’ are3: a. Model - a physical, mathematical or otherwise logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process; and b. Simulation - the execution of a system model over time. 5. M&S is a key enabler for Defence that is increasingly supporting a wide range of activity that includes: decision making, training and education, mission rehearsal, acquisition, operational analysis, test and evaluation, and experimentation. Such disparate activities provide a challenge in the delivery of VfM in accordance with JSPs 901 and 906 and the exploitation of investment. Purpose of this JSP 6. This JSP is designed to: a. direct, ensure and assure the coherent development of M&S as an enabler in support of Defence Outputs. b. ensure Defence will have effective and technically coherent M&S based capabilities that are interoperable, reconfigurable, innovative and provide VfM at the Defence Enterprise level.

DTC – 3.1. 109 The DTC will deliver Defence Trainers that are fit for purpose. Trainers110 are not only the focus for teaching knowledge and skills but also for inspiring, encouraging, supporting and challenging teams, through strong leadership, role modelling and coaching. Well-motivated teams become independent learners, who continue to regulate their learning wherever they are. Whatever their ability levels, teams require regular feedback and support to help them assess their knowledge and skills so that they can learn to identify and set their own goals for further professional development. 2. Defence Trainer attributes. Defence Trainers need to be able to inspire, motivate and challenge teams, understand their learning needs and expectations, and be able to draw on the right tools and techniques to get the very best from them. To be fully effective, trainers should therefore understand and fulfil both the Roles of the specialist trainer and that of leader, which include: a. Role modelling. Through the adoption and promotion of the Service core values, trainers lay the foundations for the behaviours that build team cohesion and underpin operational effectiveness. Role modelling is therefore a core responsibility. b. Facilitating inclusive learning. Trainers should create an inclusive learning environment where all teams have the opportunity to learn and reach their full potential. Good trainers are able to facilitate learning in the most appropriate way to suit the needs of the teams. Trainers will need a sound understanding of learning theory and a broad range of skills including the use of modern teaching techniques, learning technologies and coaching. c. Assessment of learning. Assessment is an essential part of training delivery and trainers are often asked to make critical decisions regarding teams’ progress through training and subsequent achievement of the required standards. The proper conduct of assessment has implications for training time, resources and effective capability. Good trainers are able to administer assessments in training in a fair, valid and reliable manner in accordance with the AStrat and ASpecs provided. 109 This DTC content is large specific to – and similar to – DTC policy for individual training.

MEAT evaluation provides the opportunity to take criteria other than price into account when awarding a contract. Appropriate, specific, and relevant award criteria are scored and weighted to establish which tender is most economically advantageous. These criteria should be transparent so that bidders are aware of all elements considered by the MOD in identifying the most economically advantageous tender (JSP 507 Part 1.pdf, pages 43-46).

It is a systematic evaluation of a Tenderer’s ability to meet draft contract requirements and is undertaken by the MOD Acquisition Organisation, at the Tenderer’s premises, in support of project TA activities. 4.4.4.2 When to use PCAE Where concerns exist regarding the Tenderer’s past performance or the proposed controls detailed in the Tenderer’s bid, PCAE may be used to explore the validity of these concerns and establish the level of risk associated with the Tenderer’s bid and enable the development of effective risk mitigation activities. The requirement to undertake PCAE is a decision taken by the MOD Acquisition Organisation and should be included in any Special Notices and Instructions47 raised in support of the draft contract. PCAE may be applied to a number of functional areas within the Tenderer’s organisation. This guidance considers the implementation of PCAE within the Tenderer’s Quality Management (QM) function only. 4.4.4.3 The Process The evaluation process seeks to establish evidence that supports the effective application of QM controls by the Tenderer throughout the Tenderer’s organisation and throughout the supply chain that the Tenderer proposes to use. Where evidence cannot be presented by the Tenderer, the MOD Acquisition Organisation need to establish the potential impact on the contract deliverables and ensure the impact is captured and assessed in the tender assessment documentation. Evaluation of individual Tenderer’s QM controls cannot be performed using a ‘one-size fits all’ process. Evaluation activities need to be tailored to suit concerns or perceived risks with the respective Tenderer’s bid. When planning an evaluation of the Tenderer’s QM controls, the MOD Acquisition Organisation should, as a minimum, address the following generic areas: a. the Tenderer’s ability to plan for the delivery of a product that conforms to specified requirements, including identification and understanding of contract requirements. b. the Tenderer’s proposed application of the QMS to ensure delivery of a product and/or service that fully satisfies contract requirements. 46 Specific requirements associated with conducting PCAE within Tender Assessment in the Commercial Managers Toolkit on the KiD.""

Tender Evaluation and Value for Money 64. Public contracts must be competed in accordance with Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (PCR) or Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR) (the Regulations). 65. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) enshrines principles of proportionality, equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency which the MOD must apply in relation to its contract award criteria. Application of these principles also needs to be consistent with the policy requirement to demonstrate value for money. 66. This guidance is complementary and supplementary to that contained within the Tendering Suite of Commercial Policy Statements (see www.aof.dii.r.mil.uk) addressing the key issues to ensure that commercial, legal and economic requirements are coherently addressed when establishing the criteria for tender evaluation. Evaluation Strategy 67. The first decision to make is the appropriate evaluation strategy for the proposal, and this is then published in the Contract Notice. In accordance with Regulation 31 of DSPCR and Regulation 30 of PCR, the evaluation strategy can be based on either: a. Lowest price (lowest cost). The contract will be awarded to the ‘lowest price’ tender that is technically and commercially compliant. This cannot be used if the Competitive Dialogue procedure is being followed. or b. Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT). Using an evaluation based on MEAT provides the opportunity to take criteria other than price into account when awarding a contract. There are several MEAT evaluation strategies that can be adopted. These are set out in the Commercial Policy Statement on Tender Management. Award Criteria 68. Award criteria are the criteria the tenders must meet and those that the tenders will be measured against. Where a MEAT evaluation strategy is used, appropriate, specific and relevant award criteria are scored and weighted to establish which tender is most economically advantageous. The criteria should be sufficiently transparent so that a bidder is aware of all the elements to be taken into account by MOD in identifying the most economically advantageous and the relative importance of those elements. ‘Most economically advantageous’ can be taken as being largely analogous to Value for Money (VfM), where VfM is defined as the optimal trade-off between time, cost, and effectiveness. 69. Award criteria are typically grouped into three categories: technical, commercial and financial. Deciding on the technical and commercial criteria to include is a matter of judgement and will vary from project to project, but each needs to represent a specific and measurable objective. In seeking to establish fundamental end objectives it is useful to:""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 149: ""A  Technical M  V  Optimal VFM point VfM ranking: V>C>A>B C  Bids in this zone unacceptable due to quality   terms will be judged as the Most Economically Advantageous Tender. Where two or more tenders have the same cost, the tender with the highest technical score should be judged as the Most Economically Advantageous Tender. 36. Any tender on the line from the origin 0 to Tender C will be assessed as better value for money (more economically advantageous) than tenders on the line 0A, which in turn will be better value for money than tenders on the line from 0 to Tender B. 37. Adding risk and uncertainty to the bids and estimated whole life costs, and subjecting this to Monte Carlo analysis allows the outputs to be expressed as 10%, 50%, and 90% confidence figures. The 10/50/90 percentiles of two bids may overlap, so it is then necessary to have a decision rule, particularly when a ‘lowest price’ strategy is to be used, to establish if the bids are sufficiently different from each other such that one could be selected as having the lowest cost. Defence Economics and D Scrutiny must always be consulted in such cases. Sensitivity Analysis 38. It is good practice to test any proposed criterion, weighting, and calculations in a variety of scenarios prior to issue of the Tender Documentation to ensure that various permutations of tenders (e.g. close tenders, abnormally low tenders, low technical scores etc.) do not distort the result or produce unexpected outcomes. Disclosure 39. Proposals to disclose financial information such as affordability envelopes or budget profiles to industry must be compliant with legal obligations including those of transparency and equal treatment, and. Assessing Value for Money Through-Life 40. When the Department is considering entering into partnering arrangement at the investment level, or an LTPA, or any form of non-competitive contract, the business case must establish how the continuing value for money will be assessed through the life of the agreement or contract. Clear performance targets must be established, against which industry’s performance will be assessed. 41. Details should be provided in the business case of the regular reviews, targets, and quality standards that will be used to assess and manage industry’s performance. A range of measures should be adopted to ensure through-life value for money is achieved in non-competitive, partnering arrangements. This is discussed in the paragraphs below: A robust “should-cost” benchmark model 42. This can be built up on the basis of input quantities and rates using data available about the methods of delivering the design or service anticipated.

Deciding on the technical and commercial criteria to include is a matter of judgement and will vary from project to project, but each needs to represent a specific and measurable objective. In seeking to establish fundamental end objectives it is useful to: a. Repeatedly ask the question ‘Why do you care about that?’; b. Ask how the options differ from one another in ways that matter;""  ', '']"
146,What is configuration management?,"Configuration management (CM) is a process where configuration baselines are established and all changes to those baselines are managed. It includes the control of configuration baselines, coherence between product and its documentation, implementation of changes or updates to documentation, dissemination of change, stakeholder communication, and recording and management of concessions, repairs, deviations, or non-conformance (JSP 945 Part 2, page 6). CM is a critical enabler for equipment safety and supportability throughout a product's lifecycle and provides traceability of user requirements to the eventual manufacture of equipment, development of software, or provision of a service (JSP 945 Part 1, page 6). It ensures repeatable performance, standardisation, safety, quality, reliability, availability, maintainability, traceability, interchangeability, supportability, and interoperability as well as establishing system/sub-system interfaces (JSP 945 Part 1, page 6-8). CM is the through-life management of changes to the product or services throughout the Concept, Assessment, Demonstration, Manufacture, In-Service and Disposal cycle (JSP 945 Part 1, page 8). It enables changes and different build standards to be traced back to the system requirements and may be introduced to mitigate or nullify the effects of product deterioration due to ageing, corrosion, or repair (JSP 945 Part 1, page 8)","['This passage is from JSP 945 Part 2.pdf, page 6: ""4 Change Management 4.1 Configuration Change Management (CCM) CCM is the process where configuration baselines are established, and all changes managed.

CM, Government Quality Assurance and Quality Management combine to build confidence that the product supplied to the end user is fit for purpose. CM is a critical enabler for equipment safety and supportability throughout a product’s lifecycle. 1.2 Configuration Management CM must be considered at the earliest stages in the capability lifecycle as it provides traceability of user requirements through to the eventual manufacture of equipment, development of software or the provision of a service. The objective of CM is to define and manage the system’s physical and functional characteristics by traceable specifications, datasheets, drawings and related documentation. This will identify configuration to the lowest appropriate level, required to assure repeatable performance, standardisation, safety, quality, reliability, availability, maintainability, traceability, interchangeability, supportability and interoperability as well as establishing system / sub-  system interfaces. Supporting documentation that affects the configuration of the Capability will also benefit from its own CM. This can include technical drawings, specifications and standards relating to equipment, service, software and firmware. CM is the through life management of changes to the product or services through the Concept, Assessment, Demonstration, Manufacture, In-Service and Disposal cycle. It enables changes and different build standards to be traced back to the system requirements. These changes may be introduced to mitigate or nullify the effects of product deterioration due to ageing, corrosion or repair on repair. The changes may also take the form of in-service modification to improve safety, reduce risk, mitigate obsolescence, improve performance, improve supportability, comply with legislative changes, provide enhanced capability, allow for technology insertion or the correction of product defects. 1.3 Applying Configuration Management All MOD Organisations responsible for the development, procurement and logistics support of Military Capability shall: a. Develop and Document a CM Strategy. The strategy shall evolve into a Project CM Plan (PCMP) defining how this will be implemented, where responsibilities lie and timescales as the project progresses through the project life cycle. Depending on the complexity and risk within the project, the MOD organisation may contract for a Deliverable CM Plan (DCMP). The DCMP shall be in accordance with Defence Standard (Def Stan) 05-057. b. Ensure the Configuration Status is defined and traceable to the User Requirements at acceptance and before the product is brought Under Ministry Control (UMC).""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 945 Part 1.pdf, page 8: ""c. Assign a suitably competent person who is responsible for the application of CM and who is to ensure that all CM activities are implemented and formally recorded. d. Ensure effective CM for the product throughout its lifecycle invoking Def Stan 05-057 in procurement and logistics support contracts if the MOD organisation has chosen to contract CM of defence materiel. The continued drive for value for money has increased the use of Commercial Of The Shelf (COTS), Military / Modified Of The Shelf (MOTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI). These items shall also be subjected to CM. If such items are to be excluded from CM, MOD Organisations must state the reasons why and demonstrate that the risks in doing so have been adequately addressed. This information must be clearly articulated in the CM Plan. 1.4 Configuration Management Principles The MOD Organisation Team Leader is ultimately responsible for the implementation of Configuration Management policy and ensuring the 5 Key CM Principles are applied appropriately, as follows: a. CM and Planning. CM describes the activities and processes required to ensure that changes to the Configuration Items (CIs) happen in a controlled and traceable environment. The Project Configuration Management Plan (PCMP) details how and when these activities and processes will be carried out. The PCMP itself will be subject to CM (version control) and will be reviewed at a periodicity set by the document owner. b. Configuration Identification. An activity that identifies a component, document or assembly, referred to as a CI by its physical, functional, or performance characteristics. This can be by means of drawings, specifications (both hardware and software), or datasheets. Not all items are classified as CIs. The classification of an item as a CI can be decided by the Design Organisation or by mutual agreement between the Project Team and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The item must conform to strict criteria detailed in the Configuration Management documentation. c. Configuration Change Management (Control). CCM (or CCC) is the through life management of changes to the CI. CCM identifies the Authority responsible for changes and enables decisions to be made on proposed changes. CCM also manages the integration of changes to the product’s design and ensures that any interfacing or interoperability issues are managed and resolved. CCM details the requirement for configuration control boards and committees as well as establishing the Terms of Reference (TORs) for attendees. d. Configuration Status Accounting. Provides a record of the build state of the CIs both past and present. It will contain a record of proposed changes, waivers, deviations and the implementation status of authorised changes. It will also contain a record of the identification numbers, a record of Configuration Documentation, as well as the record of the results from Functional and Physical Configuration Audits. e""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 945 Part 1.pdf, page 4: ""Functional Management and Training 5.

148,How does damage control surgery differ from in-theatre surgery?,"Damage Control Surgery (DCS) and In-Theatre Surgery are two distinct surgical interventions as described in JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1. DCS is the initial surgical intervention provided within 1 to 2 hours of wounding, with the aim to stabilize the patient and prevent further deterioration until they can be evacuated to a definitive care facility (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 10). In contrast, In-Theatre Surgery is a delayed surgical intervention that may consist of several procedures spread over a period of time and requires the movement of patients between Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within a theatre of operations (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13). In-Theatre Surgery is usually performed in a DHC unit and may involve a combination of general, orthopaedic, and burns & plastic surgery (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13).

It is integral to PR and is an inter-disciplinary effort, rather than solely a surgical challenge. In particular, DCS will require critical care support either at that Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) or at an alternative MTF accessible by Critical Care Air Support Team level TACEVAC within an appropriate timeline. DCS should be followed later on by In-Theatre Surgery, which is delayed until the various physiological and other relevant parameters have been restored to as close to normal as possible. It can only occur within a DHC unit. This usually requires a combination of general and orthopaedic surgery and should include burns & plastic surgery wherever possible. (3) In-Theatre Surgery. In-Theatre Surgery may consist of several surgical procedures spread over a period of time and may require the movement of patients between MTFs within a theatre of operations. The requirement for In-Theatre Surgery is dictated by both the patient’s condition and operational circumstances. The factors to be considered when considering a patient’s condition include the requirement to halt physiological deterioration and adequate debridement, anatomical repair and therapeutic intervention to allow safe evacuation to a definitive care facility; operational factors may include extended evacuation timelines that demand further definitive surgical interventions for patient safety; appropriate definitive surgery to permit deliberate retention in-theatre and appropriate definitive surgery for patients ineligible for evacuation out of theatre. (4) Enhanced Diagnostics. Enhanced diagnostics are those clinical support activities (e.g. CT scan if not available as part of DCS, interventional radiology, and specialist laboratory support including biochemistry, haematology and microbiology testing) that enable clinical therapies to address the specific cause of injury or illness that are additional to generic stabilising therapies. (5) Mission Specific Clinical Capabilities. Mission specific clinical capabilities29 are those clinical and clinical support capabilities that are mission-tailored for each specific operation dependent on the CBRNE3T and MRoE. 27 E.g. a patient may initially receive DCS in a Role 2 Light Manoeuvre unit, have general In-Theatre Surgery in a Role 2 Enhanced facility and then be transferred to a Role 3 facility for sub-specialist care (e.g. ophthalmology or neurosurgery) prior to STRATEVAC. This includes established facilities in the maritime environment. 28 Maritime Role 3 is unlikely to be fixed and will probably be exposed to an increased threat in a forward position.""

(2) PR incorporates DCR for care of the trauma patient. DCR is defined as ‘a systemic approach to major trauma combining the <C>ABC (catastrophic bleeding, airway, breathing, circulation) paradigm with a series of clinical techniques from point of wounding to definitive treatment in order to minimise blood loss, maximise tissue oxygenation and optimise outcome23.’ (3) PHEC comprises 4 clinical phases, 1 non-clinical node and 2 clinical nodes of care.

It can be provided by any ’extended-trained’ individual (incorporating Team Medic or other authorised extended qualification plus all DMS clinical personnel). TFC incorporates CUF. (b) Care Under Fire. CUF is those techniques necessary to provide immediate life-saving interventions to the casualty in the Hot Zone while the patient is being extracted. The requirement for CUF is the basis of all first aid training taught to all members of the Armed Forces. (c) Enhanced Field Care. EFC is that emergency clinical care usually provided by a clinical team made possible by a more permissive environment using Battlefield Progressive Trauma Life Support (BATLS),24 CBRN-EMT25 and other progressive clinical techniques (as prescribed in Joint Service Publication (JSP) 999 Clinical Guidelines for Operations). (d) Prolonged Field Care. PFC is those additional techniques that sustain the casualty if the 10-1-2+2 Medical Planning Guideline is likely to be exceeded. 26 (4) Casualty Decontamination Area. The CDA is the location where contamination by threats (CBRNE3T) is removed from a casualty in order to remove any future threat to the health of the patient or the operational patient care system.

149,What force protection measures can I employ to reduce the risk of having cases of malaria?,"According to JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, the following force protection measures can help reduce the risk of having cases of malaria:

a. Bite avoidance measures: This includes using insecticide-treated bed nets properly, providing mosquito-screened accommodation, and wearing long sleeves and long trousers/skirts in areas of malaria risk, particularly at peak biting times (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, pages 5 and 18).
b. Chemoprophylaxis: Commanders or Duty Holders are to ensure that all personnel deploying to a malaria risk area have undergone a malaria health risk assessment before they deploy and have been provided with appropriate anti-malarial drugs (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 11).
c. Awareness of risk: Commanders or Duty Holders are to ensure that all personnel receive a pre-deployment health brief and understand the risk posed to themselves and the operation by malaria (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 11).
d. Diagnose promptly and treat without delay: Medical Officers are to report all suspected and confirmed cases of malaria in accordance with current statutory requirements and report using the FMed 85 and MOD Modified PHE malaria report form (JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1.pdf, page 27).

Personnel cannot be compelled to take any drug. The management of individuals refusing to comply with malaria preventive measures is an administrative, rather than a medical or disciplinary issue, and the individual should be risk managed in accordance with sS administrative procedures.

Further details may be found in JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-3 Pest Management Policy in the Armed Forces. a. Bed nets. Wherever practicable, and whether they are indoors or out of doors, personnel in malaria endemic areas are to sleep under mosquito nets. Insecticide treated bed nets are particularly effective. However, bed nets are only effective if used properly: (1) The bed net is to be checked regularly for holes and replaced if any holes are discovered. Holes should be repaired before next use if replacement is not possible. (2) Before retiring at night, the bed net is to be tucked carefully under the camp bed, mattress, sleeping mat or sleeping bag. (3) The inside of the net is to be checked for trapped insects before retiring. Knockdown insecticide should be applied. (4) Personnel are to try to ensure that no part of their body is in contact with the net during the night, as insects will bite through the mesh. b. Mosquito Screens. In fixed locations, every attempt is to be made to provide mosquito-screened accommodation and as far as operationally practicable, personnel should avoid being outside such accommodation at peak biting times. c. Clothing. Personnel are to be reminded that minimising the amount of exposed skin will offer some protection against biting insects. Long sleeves and long trousers/skirts are to be worn in in areas of malaria risk, particularly at peak biting times.

It is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. In 2015/16, there was an estimated 212 million cases of malaria with 429,000 deaths worldwide. 90% of cases and 92% of deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.6 Malaria is a disease of military significance, with the outbreak amongst UK troops in Sierra Leone in 2000 generating attack rates of 10% in certain groups.7 The British Armed Forces have been largely successful in mitigating the threat from malaria. Between October 2014 and November 2015, 1530 individuals were deployed on Operation GRITROCK during the British military response to the outbreak of Ebola viral haemorrhagic fever in West Africa.8 During this period there were only seven cases of malaria and UK Armed Forces have not experienced an operationally related death from malaria since 1992.9 10. The prevention of malaria is based upon four principles: a. Awareness of risk. b. Bite prevention. c. Chemoprophylaxis. d. Diagnose promptly and treat without delay. In addition, the military Chain of Command has a key role to play through the integration of malaria preventive measures into force health protection (FHP) risk assessments and plans. Responsibilities 11. Commanders or Duty Holders are to ensure that: a. A suitable FHP risk assessment10 for the deployment/exercise has been undertaken by their medical staff. b. Where compliance with malaria preventive measures cannot be fully achieved for operational reasons the residual risk is acknowledged and managed in accordance with JSP 892: Risk Management. c. All personnel receive a pre-deployment health brief. d. All personnel deploying to a malaria risk area have undergone a malaria health risk assessment before they deploy. e. All vector control and bite avoidance control measures are enforced. f. Personnel understand the risk posed to themselves and the operation by malaria, the purpose and importance of malaria preventive measures and are encouraged (but not mandated) to comply with malaria chemoprophylaxis regimes. g. All personnel are in possession of a Malaria Warning Card (FMed 568) before they leave a malaria risk area and that it is retained by the individual for two years. 6 WHO Malaria Factsheet dated December 16.

This JSP 950 leaflet outlines the Surgeon General’s policy on the prevention of malaria in UK Armed Forces personnel. This policy has been developed with reference to UK national guidance produced and published by the Public Health England (PHE) Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention (ACMP)1. This guidance recognises that the malaria risk is different in military and civilian travellers. 2. This policy does not apply to dependants accompanying UK Armed Forces personnel on overseas posting or other civilian groups for whom the DMS provides care. They are to be advised in accordance with extant ACMP guidance. 3. This leaflet replaces and cancels JSP 950 Leaflet 3-3-1: Preventing Malaria in Military Populations dated Aug 16. Aim 4. This leaflet defines the responsibilities of commanders, medical staff and entitled individuals with respect to protection against malaria and outlines arrangements that are specific to UK Armed Forces Personnel. Other core references 5. This leaflet adds military specific direction to existing ACMP national guidelines.1 6. For joint operations, detailed mission tailored malaria prevention requirements will be described in the relevant Force Health Protection Instruction (FHPI), ratified by the Defence Public Health Unit (DPHU). For single Service (sS) operations, detailed mission tailored malaria prevention requirements will be outlined in the overarching sS medical directive and mounting instruction ratified by the sS Public Health (PH) consultant or Competent Medical Authority (CMA).2 For overseas training exercises, courses or adventurous training, the relevant mounting or joining instructions are to describe the malaria prevention regime. If this is not explicit, advice should be sought from the relevant sS HQ or CMA. 7. For individual Service Personnel undertaking non-operational travel to a malarious area, a malaria health risk assessment is to be carried out using UK open source travel health advisory resources3, 4 prior to providing anti-malarial advice and chemoprophylaxis. Expert PH advice should be sought from DPHU if required.5 8. All anti-malarial drugs have contraindications and a side effect profile which can be found in the British National Formulary (BNF) or online at the Electronic Medicines Compendium. It is incumbent upon the healthcare professional to undertake a health risk assessment and to warn patients of the possible side effects of any anti-malarial drug. 1 Chiodini PL, Patel D, Whitty CJM and Lalloo DG.

The management of suspected cases of malaria is to be in accordance with the guidance provided in JSP 950 Volume 11: Clinical Guidelines for Operations. 27. Medical Officers are to report all suspected and confirmed cases of malaria in accordance with current statutory requirements21 to the Proper Officer of the relevant local authority. In addition, Medical Officers or other clinical staff should report suspected and confirmed cases of malaria using the FMed 85 iaw JSP 950 Leaflet 7-2-2 and the MOD Modified PHE malaria report form at Annex D. Once completed, both forms are to be sent to SO2 Health Protection, HQ SG who will be responsible for onward transmission of the latter to the Malaria Reference Laboratory. SO2 Health Protection is to maintain a database of suspected/confirmed cases of malaria. This database is to be reviewed at each routine FHP Board. Special considerations 28. Aircrew. The policy for malaria chemoprophylaxis in RN, Army and RAF Aircrew and Controllers is contained within AP1269A Leaflet 5-19 paragraph 38. The terms Aircrew and Controllers are defined within MAA02: Military Aviation Authority Master Glossary. As both these documents are reviewed periodically, medical staff should view the electronic resources before making clinical decisions. 29. Divers. Specific direction concerning malaria protection for divers is at Annex A. 30. Immunocompromised individuals. Individuals suffering from medical conditions that might render them immunocompromised or otherwise alter their susceptibility to malaria will require occupational health assessment of their fitness to deploy to malarial risk areas. Those who have no spleen, or whose splenic function is severely impaired, are at particular risk of severe malaria and should not deploy to malaria endemic areas. 31. Pregnancy. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication for travel to malaria risk areas. However, pregnant women are more susceptible to malaria; the disease is generally more severe in pregnancy and may result in an adverse outcome to the pregnancy. Pregnant Servicewomen are not to deploy to malaria risk areas. 32. Aircraft stopovers. When the final destination of an aircraft, or planned stopovers en route, are known to be within a malaria endemic area, all passengers and crew are to be in possession of a personal supply of anti-malaria medication. It is the responsibility of the deploying unit to issue all personnel with the appropriate anti-malaria drugs. 33. Diverted aircraft. In the event that an aircraft is diverted to a malaria endemic area, a senior member of the crew is to seek advice from the Medical Officer at the home base of the aircraft. Passengers are not to be allowed to disperse until suitable arrangements have been made to ensure that they receive appropriate anti-malaria drugs and advice. 34. Diverted ships. In the event that a vessel is diverted to a malaria endemic area, advice is to be sought from NCHQ""  ', '']"
150,How is human security incorporated into training activities?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, human security is incorporated into training activities through a through-career HS education and training pathway (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 38, paragraphs 0501-0502). This includes internal training designed and delivered in line with JSP 822, as well as international training for students from focus countries funded by the MOD (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 38, paragraph 0503). Additionally, all personnel must receive HS awareness training as a baseline, and specialist training is provided for individuals working in roles at the operational and strategic level which require HS integration or delivery (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 38, paragraph 0504). The Human Security in Defence Course (Defence TRAD) is also mentioned as a specialist training option (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 38, paragraph 0504).

Furthermore, the reference text explains that human security is an approach to national and international security which places emphasis on human beings rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 1, paragraphs 0101-0102). The UK's Human Security approach is governed by domestic and international law and is complementary to several UK Government strategies (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 1, paragraph 0102). Therefore, human security considerations are integrated into all that the UK Defence does, from strategic planning through to operational and tactical levels, in order to better plan conflict sensitive outcomes, minimize harm to civilians, reduce Human Rights violations, and ultimately improve conditions for stability (JSP 985 Vol 1.pdf, page 1, paragraphs 0101-0103).

Internal Training will be designed and delivered in line with JSP 822, Defence Direction and Guidance for Training and Education. The lead TRA will be Strategic Command HQ for UK Defence level requirements. sS will lead for Service level training. They must aim to ensure that inclusion of HS is in command and leadership training and ensure, where relevant, that deployed personnel have HS training appropriate for the region and context to which they are deploying. sS must develop staff understanding of HS issues and more tri-service and Joint roles likely to be undertaken as leaders progress through their career. 0503. International Training. The delivery of HS training overseas will continue48 and should be considered in line with JSP 510, International Defence Training. IPS and Defence sections should consider promoting the HS in Defence course to nations, run by the Defence Leadership School at the Defence Academy. Although not listed in JSP 510, the TRA reserve up to 20 places for International Students to attend on two courses a year, which supports UK Defence’s commitment to UNSCR 1325. Applications can be made in accordance with the HS Defence Information Note and students from the published NAP focus countries will be UK funded49. Thereafter, it is the discretion of the demand signal and the MOD central HS team as to whether the UK funds the place. Consideration to funding will be given to each place on its own merit, with particular focus on how it supports UK Defence global engagement objectives and IPS priority frameworks. Where doubt over the basis of agreement exists, clarification and guidance on ESCAPADE entries can be sought from the MOD central HS team. Moreover, places on the UK delivered BI course for Senior Leaders and BI Train the Trainer courses should be bid for, also delivered by Defence Academy. 0504. Individual training.

As the world has changed, so too has the character of conflict. Human Rights violations, the targeting of civilians and the destruction of cultural property are being increasingly weaponised in armed conflict and used to create instability. Universal threats to the population continue to compromise the prospects of sustainable development, peace and stability. As these threats overlap and multiply, the cumulative effect of insecurity can be catastrophic for individuals, communities, nations and regions. UK Defence must keep pace to address these changing threats and, to do this, we must adopt a Human Security approach. Human Security is an approach to national and international security which places the emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state. Moving the security agenda beyond state security does not mean replacing it; rather, it complements and builds on it. It is applicable to situations above and below the threshold of armed conflict, across all domains and surpasses geographical boundaries. This pervasiveness of Human Security means that it is vital that it is considered across the spectrum of UK Defence. UK Defence’s Human Security approach is governed by international and domestic law and is underpinned by United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), NATO policies and the National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security. This JSP directs the UK Armed Forces to implement those UNSCRs which relate to Human Security considerations. It explains why and how UK Defence must incorporate Human Security considerations in all that it does, from strategic planning through to the activity performed at the operational and tactical levels. In doing this, we will be able to better plan conflict sensitive outcomes by understanding the impacts on the human environment, minimising harm to civilians and reducing Human Rights’ violations, ultimately improving the conditions for stability. This policy reinforces the direction of the Integrated Operating Concept and recognises that the implementation of Human Security requires a whole of government approach, with military objectives integrated within a broader cross government strategy. By coordinating with other actors, we can shape the discourse on the security of human beings on the global stage and increase the prospects for long term peace and stability. JSP 985 is rightly ambitious and, to achieve its objectives and maximise its potential, will require support from leadership at all levels across UK Defence.

International Framework of Human Security. The concept of HS integrates three freedoms: ‘Freedom from Fear’ (denoting violent threats to populations), ‘Freedom from Want’ (meaning poverty and absence of basic needs) and ‘Freedom from Indignity’ (which includes human rights abuses and limits on democratic participation). These have been developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to include all threats to the wellbeing of human beings and everything that affects the security of human beings.2 HS is an approach to national and international security which places emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state. Moving the security agenda beyond state security does not mean replacing it. Instead, it complements and builds on it. This concept has continued to evolve. Threats such as natural disasters, conflicts, chronic and persistent poverty, health pandemics and international terrorism continue to compromise the prospects of sustainable development, peace and stability. When these threats overlap, they become insecurity multipliers, exacerbating existing issues. The cumulative effect of this insecurity can be catastrophic, for individuals, but also for communities, nations and regions.3 This HS concept is now an international framework4 that considers pre, inter and post conflict phases, examines early warning mechanisms and responds to violent and destabilising situations. 0102. National Policy and Strategy. The UK’s HS approach is governed by domestic and international law and is complementary to the following UK Government strategies: a. Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict; b. UK National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security 2018-2022; c. Modern Slavery Strategy; d. UK Anti-Corruption Strategy 2017-2022; e. Building Stability Overseas and the CONTEST Strategy. 0103. UK Defence’s Human Security Approach. Individual and community security is the foundation for long term stability, economic and infrastructure development, political settlement, better societal relationships, good governance and the rule of law. In recognition of this, the UK MOD has embedded several security themes under the term HS. By monitoring and improving the security of these areas the UK seeks to mitigate the most harmful effects of conflict and increase the chance of a sustainable and 2 From conflict and crime to both physical and psychological suffering. 3 United Nations (January 2016).
