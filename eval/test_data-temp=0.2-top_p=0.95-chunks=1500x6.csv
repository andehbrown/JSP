1,What should I do in an emergency situation on a bulk fuel carrying vehicle?,"According to the reference text from JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 194, in the event of an accident or emergency on a bulk fuel carrying vehicle, the members of the vehicle crew are advised to apply the braking system, stop the engine and isolate the battery, avoid sources of ignition, inform appropriate emergency services, put on warning vests and place out warning signs, keep transport documents readily available, stay upwind and avoid inhalation of fumes, smoke, dusts and vapors, use fire extinguishers to put out small fires in tyres, brakes, and engine compartments, and move away from the vicinity of the accident or emergency and advise others to do the same (Annex B - BFCV Emergency Action Plan).

Additionally, when bulk fuel carrying vehicles are being loaded or unloaded, the driver is required to report to the site control point/office for relevant instructions on emergency procedures, loading operations, and traffic control systems. It is also the driver's responsibility to carry out actions such as venting hoses to atmosphere immediately after liquid valves are closed, draining hoses of liquid before blanks are fitted, and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 65).

In case of a spillage, every effort should be made to evacuate the area except for personnel dealing with the emergency, do not operate electrical equipment unless flameproof, approach from upwind, and set up an exclusion zone around the incident (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).

It is important to note that these guidelines may vary depending on the specific regulations applicable to the situation, such as those for internal use of fuels and lubricants aboard ships or vessels, aircraft operated by the Services or specialist contractors or agencies, or the repair of MOD vehicles or aircraft for which special regulations apply (JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 11)","['This passage is from JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 194: ""ANNEX B - BFCV EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN In the event of an accident or emergency that may occur or arise during carriage, the members of the vehicle crew shall take the following actions where safe and practicable to do so: 1.

* Gloves or gauntlets that meet the minimum specification BS EN 511
* Hand gloves should be a loose fit and have an elasticated knitted wrist
* No inner layers of gloves are recommended
* No jewellery on hands and wrists, including watches and rings

Additionally, you may need to wear gauntlet-style gloves if there is a specific requirement identified in the process risk assessment for you to work with your hands at or above chest level.

It's important to note that clothing should be well fitting yet easy to remove, all clothing shall be maintained clean and free from oil and grease, and there should be no open pockets or turn-ups where liquid can collect. All pockets require storm flaps, and the hood, if fitted, must be stowable. Cuffs should be double layered to prevent the ingress of liquid, and gloves should be secured over the inner layer. Aprons are not recommended as they may trap liquid between the apron and inner clothing.

It's also forbidden to wear items that have the potential to cause a spark in close proximity to cryogenic liquids, including Personal Electronic Devices, matches, cigarette lighters, smoking materials, etc. (JSP 319 Part 2.odt, page 0)

If the family is entitled to a place in a MOD school, the child can continue attending that school as long as the Service parent continues to serve or be employed on the overseas Command or the family retains official dependent status (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 15). Parents may also seek admission to a host nation school in preference to the local MOD school, but they will be responsible for all educational expenses and may not reclaim them (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 15). If the child is entitled to a place in a MOD school in the country of origin during an unaccompanied tour or for genuine compassionate reasons, an application must be submitted to HQ DCYP for approval before the child is enrolled (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 15). Parents are also advised to research education provision overseas and engage with CEAS at the earliest opportunity to discuss options for educational provision (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 4). If the child has special educational needs or disabilities (SEND), it is essential that parents submit a Parental Declaration and Pupil Information Profile to the CEAS team within DCYP and liaise with the school in the overseas location for assessment and advice on supportability (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 23).

The recent comprehensive review of JSP 360 – Use of Military Aerodromes by Civil Aircraft – provided the opportunity to review insurance-related content and make a clear distinction between the insurance requirements of aircraft taking off and landing at a MOD aerodrome and those aircraft conducting Display Flying activity. 5. The issue was subsequently tabled for discussion with the Department’s professional insurance brokers, Willis Towers Watson, in the autumn of 2018. It was recognised that there is a clear distinction between routine operations and training and aircraft conducting Display Flying activity. Consideration was given to an appropriate insurance limit of liability relevant to the risk exposure at MOD aerodromes. Consensus from experts at the Willis aerospace team and MOD’s claims officials was that a limit of indemnity insurance commensurate with the risks associated with Display Flying activities should be adopted which is available in the prevailing aviation market.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 360 Part 2.pdf, page 27: "". There is no requirement for a civil user to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit unless the aircraft is conducting Display Flying activity. Therefore, the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes, as set out in JSP 360, should be followed. Q4. Will civilian aircraft participating solely in a static display be required to increase their aviation liability insurance to the £50 million liability limit? A4. There is no requirement for a static display aircraft to increase insurance to the £50 million liability limit unless it is conducting Display Flying activity. Therefore, the insurance arrangements for civil operators landing and taking off at MOD aerodromes, as set out in JSP 360, should be followed for aircraft involved in static displays. Q5. When a display team, either formation or singleton, performs Display Flying activity, is the £50 million insurance liability limit required for each aircraft, or per display. A5. The display team lead should check with their respective insurer, but aviation liability insurance is normally written on a per aircraft basis for the Flying Display. The key issue is to ensure that the insurance policy is valid and will respond to an incident resulting from each particular Flying Display or Display Flying activity conducted throughout the year.""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 360 Part 2.pdf, page 28: ""How the insurance policy is written will very much depend on the frequency of Display Flying activity undertaken by the pilot. Q6. Will the £50 million limit of liability apply to flypasts at Flying Displays for either singleton or formation aircraft? A6. The definition of a flypast in RA 2335 involves Air Systems flying, either singly or in formation, over or past a gathering of spectators along a pre-planned route without manoeuvring, other than when necessary for safe and accurate navigation. Accordingly, they will not include aerobatic manoeuvres. The risk is lower than Display Flying and there would not be a requirement to increase insurance to the £50 million limit of liability. Q7. Does the £50 million limit of liability apply to foreign military registered aircraft conducting Display Flying activity? A7. In the absence of any separate agreement (i.e. NATO Status of Forces Agreement for example) setting out the insurance position, the requirement for the £50 million limit of liability will apply for Display Flying. Q8. Will civilian users at MOD aerodromes or private display clubs require the £50 million limit of liability for practice displays at a MOD aerodrome on a regular or ad hoc basis? A8.

This revised edition of JSP 368 is a direction on compliance with Treasury policy on charging for the supply of goods and services to external organisations. It reflects Treasury policy on fees, charges and levies which is contained in Managing Public Money, Chapter 6. 2. JSP 368 translates Treasury policy into guidance on best practice for use within the Department. When MOD carries out non-core tasks for outside bodies such as Foreign Governments, other government departments, Trading Funds, Charities, Museums and commercial companies, the guiding principle is; MOD is not funded for these tasks and must not do them unless the department’s costs are met by the charges raised. Core tasks are funded from the Defence Budget and the question of charging does not therefore arise. Charging 3. It is government policy to charge for goods and services. This policy is expressed in the Treasury guidance: Managing Public Money, where it is states that charges should be set to recover the full costs of goods or services provided including: “Charges within and among central government organisations should be made at full cost. To charge otherwise would risk creating unwarranted subsidies or distorting competition.” The MOD general charging policy as set out in this JSP reflects the Treasury guidance with special charging arrangements being included in the enclosed annexes. 4""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 368.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 368 – The MOD Guide to Repayment Chapter 2, Annex 2.11 SPECIAL CHARGING ARRANGEMENTS \uf0b7 MOD support options will include the issue of Government Furnished Equipment or Facilities, direct tasking of the MOD supplying unit by the Project Team as well as a separate formal sales contract with the defence contractor. Charging and Pricing under Circular Contracting \uf0b7 The Department is not normally funded to provide services to external organisations and all costs must therefore be recovered. \uf0b7 Marginal costing should normally be applied to reduce the overall cost of the prime procurement contract to Defence. General Principles 1. The Department contracts extensively with industry to procure a range of services and equipment. It is normally a decision for contractors whether they subcontract out specialist services to other suppliers and to secure competitive prices from its supply chain. 2. The final contract price to MOD will therefore comprise the prime contractor’s own costs, subcontract prices plus elements for insurance and mark-up management fees, administration and profit. Mark-up charges are normally calculated as a percentage of the prime contractor’s total costs (including their subcontract costs). 3. In some cases a defence contractor may not be able to subcontract activities to the commercial market but must instead use MOD facilities and services. Reasons may include: \uf0b7 MOD is the only source of supply and there is no appropriate alternative e.g""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 368.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 368 – The MOD Guide to Repayment Chapter 2, Annex 2.5 SPECIAL CHARGING ARRANGEMENTS Use of HM Ships 16. From time to time Her Majesty’s ships render assistance to other ships involved in collisions, or wreck, or in distress, or searching for missing ships, if they are in the vicinity and can do so without detriment to their primary tasks. In these circumstances no charges are raised as there is an obligation (United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea and International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) that ships of other nations perform the same service to the UK. 17. If, however, the UK is requested to make vessels available specifically for such purposes by another government department or foreign government, the vessel should be treated as being on loan to the outside body in question, and charges should be raised accordingly.

It has been adapted from the Health and Safety Executive’s guide “Working with Display Screens”. This advice is primarily aimed for users of DSE on permanent workstations. Why Should I Read This Guide? 2. Display Screen Equipment (DSE) has become one of the most common kinds of work equipment; working with DSE can lead to physical (musculoskeletal) problems, visual fatigue and mental stress. These problems are not generally caused by the DSE itself but by how the DSE is used. It is important that you are aware of the risks, what you can do to avoid the risks and what the MOD is doing to reduce them. Do I Need Training to Use DSE? 3. All DSE users need some type of training prior to using DSE so they can avoid DSE related health problems. For general office DSE work the “Display Screen Equipment” course available through the Defence learning environment (DLE) should suffice; you may also be required to undertake other training e.g. touch-typing skills, and software training.

13,Under what circumstances do I need to conduct health surveillance and monitoring as a line manager?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11 (page 25), health surveillance is necessary when the risk assessment determines that it is required due to the potential hazards of certain substances or industrial practices. It should be carried out under the direction of a suitably qualified health professional and may include initial and periodic assessments. Regular skin inspections for hands and forearms should also be conducted, either by an occupational health professional or a suitably trained responsible person within the workforce (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, page 25). Additionally, line managers are responsible for ensuring that systems are in place to identify health surveillance requirements and implementing suitable and appropriate programs for new and existing staff (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11, policy statement 6, page 9).

Furthermore, as stated in JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 11 (page 8), health surveillance is necessary when control measures for handling hazardous substances might fail or deteriorate, exposure limits might be exceeded, control measures might not be working properly, or employees are exposed to certain substances and processes specified in Schedule 5 to the COSHH Regulations.

Therefore, as a line manager, you should conduct health surveillance and monitoring when:

1. The risk assessment determines that it is required due to potential hazards of certain substances or industrial practices.
2. Regular skin inspections for hands and forearms are necessary.
3. Control measures for handling hazardous substances might fail or deteriorate, exposure limits might be exceeded, control measures might not be working properly, or employees are exposed to certain substances and processes specified in Schedule 5 to the COSHH Regulations.

The links with occupational health and safety are concerned with the effects to the long-term health of the individual from their work and workplace; and the effects that their health may have on their work, sometimes linked to chronic conditions or exposure to substances or industrial practices harmful to humans (see also JSP 418). Health surveillance and health monitoring are medical services that offer tools to identify work-related disease or ill health to help minimise the effects to help the management of the health risks. The connection between cause and effect of work-related ill health is not always obvious; it can often take some time for symptoms to develop.

14,How do I test the fit of respiratory protective equipment?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, there are two methods for testing the fit of respiratory protective equipment (RPE): qualitative fit testing (QLFT) and quantitative fit testing (QNFT).

Qualitative fit testing (QLFT) relies on the wearer's senses to determine if there is a gap in the seal between the RPE and their face by the detection of a sweet or bitter aerosol. QLFT is suitable for testing half masks and filtering facepieces (FFPs).

Quantitative fit testing (QNFT) uses specialist instrumentation to measure and calculate the leakage at the seal between the RPE and the wearer's face. Full face RPE must be tested using QNFT, while half masks and FFPs can also be tested using this method.

Both methods are conducted to a standard HSE protocol consisting of 7 exercises each lasting a minute in duration. For QNFT fit testing, these exercises are performed while the wearer is either stepping, cycling on an exercise bike, or walking on a treadmill to induce a physical workload on the wearer.

Before the test, the wearer should not eat, drink (except plain water), or chew gum for at least 15 minutes, and smokers are to refrain from smoking for at least an hour prior to the fit test.

It is not where individuals experience brief situations in which they find themselves alone, but where individuals are knowingly placed in circumstances where they work without supervision or immediate access to others. Background 2. Resource limitations and efficiency drives along with advances in telecommunications and information technology, has resulted in more activities potentially being carried out by lone workers. Lone workers may be exposed to greater risks than those conducting similar tasks as part of a team or under supervision. It is important therefore to identify Defence personnel who are lone workers, make sure there is awareness of the potential hazards and for the risks involved to be appropriately managed. 3. Employers are required to manage any health and safety risks before people can work alone. This requirement is covered by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 4. Lone workers are not to be placed at greater risk due to them working alone and if the risk assessment shows that it is not possible for the work to be done safely by a lone worker, then other arrangements must be put in place. 5""  ', '']"

It is also necessary during equipment procurement or modification activities and when there are changes to the work activity or control measures. Regular reviews of the vibration risk assessment are required every two years or sooner if there are changes to the activity or control measures.

However, it is the falls from other than high places that are not so easily recognised these may include: a. ladders, steps etc.; b. road vehicles; 1 RHPs are, for example, masts, towers and other buildings, plant rooms and installations including work platforms with permanent fixed access systems such as fixed ladders, step-irons, etc. A mast or tower structure which does not have a fixed access system but is climbable by using its lattice frame may also to be designated as an RHP. NOTE: RHPs do not apply to ships .""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 27.pdf, page 2: ""c. aircraft; and d. plant and machinery. 5. It is falls from other than high places that are often overlooked due to the smaller distances involved and the risk of serious injury is therefore not always appreciated. Falls of relatively short distance are often overlooked in the activity risk assessment as they are considered incidental to the main task. 6. The risk of falls, regardless of the distance, can have serious consequences depending on what the person or object falls onto / into. Falls remain the single biggest cause of workplace deaths and one of the main causes of major injury. The ideal method of preventing a fall from height is to remove the need for working at height. The challenge is to change the thinking and consequent behaviour and reduce the likelihood of that one act or slip which could end in tragedy; correct planning and suitable training of Defence personnel is essential to meeting this aim. Examples of work activities that are classified as working at height may include: a. working on aircraft; b. unloading and loading of vehicles (e.g. refilling tankers, using loading bays); c. maintenance of vehicles and equipment; d. working on a roof; e. erecting falsework and formwork; f. using a ladder or stepladder; g. working at ground level adjacent to an open excavation, pit or hole; h. working within an excavation, pit or hole; i. working on, or erecting scaffolding; j""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 27.pdf, page 5: ""a. they are properly planned, organised and appropriately supervised, this includes planning for emergencies and rescue; b. there is safe access and egress to the work area; c. environmental conditions that could endanger health and safety are taken into account (e.g. are the conditions; cold? wet? hot? is the location exposed to winds? what conditions could change the surface of the structure, or affect the person carrying out the work); d. work being undertaken in the same area will not affect or be affected by the working at height activity or vice versa; e. any areas where levels may change, and Defence personnel may be exposed to a fall from one level to another (e.g. a person falling into the interior of a ship from an open floor hatch or aircraft carrier hangar lift) is minimised; f. all Defence personnel and contractors involved in working at height are given appropriate information, training; are competent and supervised, or under supervised training by a competent person; g. where appropriate Defence personnel and contractors involved in working at height are physically and mentally fit to carry out their duties safely.

33,How do I prevent legionella disease outbreaks?,"To prevent legionella disease outbreaks, following the guidelines in JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32.pdf is essential. The AP should appoint a Responsible Person (RP) to manage the control of legionella and provide assurance that responsibilities are being discharged (Policy Statement 1, page 10). The RP must maintain competency and knowledge of all water systems, keep the Legionella Management Plan (LMP) current and accessible, and maintain regular contact with the AP (Policies 1 and 2, pages 10-13).

Identify sources within your Area of Responsibility (AoR) that present a risk of inhalation of legionella bacteria. Consider factors such as water temperature, storage or recirculation, nutrients, conditions that encourage bacterial growth, and the potential for water droplets to be dispersed over a wide area (Policies 2a-e, page 10). Common water systems that present a risk include cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot and cold water services, and showers (Policy 5, page 10).

Maintain the competency of personnel to recognize symptoms of Legionellosis and report any occurrences to the AP (Policies 4 and 18, pages 7, 13). Regularly review and update control measures during periods of shutdown or non-use (Policy 20, page 13). Consult Health and Safety Advisers for help and guidance on managing legionella and maintaining an LMP (Policy 16, page 13).

This chapter sets out the direction and guidance for Defence personnel involved in work activities and or who manage facilities where water is used or stored and where there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of an accumulation of legionella bacterium. Background 2. Legionnaires\' disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia which can affect anybody, but which principally affects those who are vulnerable because of age, illness, immunosuppression, smoking and so on. It is caused by the bacterium Legionella Pneumophila and related bacteria. Legionella bacteria can also cause less serious illnesses which are not fatal or permanently debilitating. The collective term used to cover the group of diseases caused by legionella bacteria is Legionellosis, the most serious of which is Legionnaires’ disease. 3. Legionellosis is normally contracted by inhaling legionella bacteria, either in tiny droplets of water or droplet nuclei (particles left after water has evaporated) contaminated with legionella, deep into the lungs. 4. Legionella bacteria are common and can be found naturally in environmental water sources such as rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Usually in low concentrations, the risk of inhalation of the bacteria from these sources is very low. Key health and safety legislation 5.

1. Consultation or discussion with persons who have local knowledge to reveal information about buried services.
2. Indications of buried services such as lampposts, telephone boxes, manhole covers, hydrant covers, concrete indicator posts, plaques on adjacent walls, and Land Quality Assessments (LQA’s) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) clearance certificates.
3. Conducting risk assessments and raising required permits to work before commencing work.
4. Consideration of all reasonably foreseeable hazards in the vicinity of the work, including height or depth from ground level, undermining or weakening of other structures, scaffolding and work platforms, trench supports and battening, falls and falling objects, work equipment/vehicles used, materials being worked on, around or removed, and PPE.
5. Hand digging to locate and confirm the existence of services with minimum risk of causing damage and exposing hazards, particularly for plastic pipes or fibre-optics that cannot be found by a locator.
6. Vigilance for buried or hidden services during excavation and repeat checks using locating devices.
7. Proper bedding and support of the tube sections to eliminate any subsequent settlement that will generate backsplash hazards from misaligned joints.
8. Use of a flexible continuous liner in the tube to avoid problems with settlement of sectional tube components.
9. Elimination of ground or obstructions within 450 mm below the prone firer's line of sight.
10. Proper drainage and provision of fire trenches at specified firing points, with consideration for animal or child safety if necessary.
11. Use of slip resistant surfaces, minimizing maintenance, and providing proper drainage for firing point surfaces.

36,How do I conduct an organisational safety assessment?,"To conduct an organisational safety assessment, follow the five-step risk assessment process outlined in JSP 375, Volume 1 Chapter 8 (Steps 1-5). Identify hazards and risks, decide who might be harmed and how, evaluate the risks and identify suitable control measures, record and implement findings, and review the risk assessment and update as necessary. Additionally, consider investigating occurrences, reviewing existing assessments of safety risks, determining and implementing any required actions, and assessing safety risks related to new or changed hazards (JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 16). Ensure that all findings and control measures are communicated to relevant personnel and that the control measures are effective, suitable, clearly communicated, fully implemented, maintained, and used properly. Lastly, evaluate organisational changes for potential safety risks and produce an Organisational Safety Assessment (OSA) as required by JSP 375, Volume 1, Chapter 35.

Change is an inevitable part of business improvement at all levels in an organisation, from increasing the efficiency of a process or updating equipment, to making major changes to organisational staffing and structure. However, while the impacts of simple changes can be readily assessed to demonstrate their effectiveness, those at the organisational level can be more difficult because of the complexity involved or the lack of recognition of the potential impact on standards of safety. 3. The evidence for this comes from investigations3 into significant safety accidents across the world.

37,How do I know if my workplace has asbestos and what precautions do I need to take if it does?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 8-12, 17-18, and 36, to identify the presence of asbestos in a workplace, a suitable and sufficient workplace risk assessment must be completed by a competent person. The assessment should include factors such as the type of work, competence of individuals involved, whether licensed contractors will need to be engaged, the need to notify the HSE of the work, type, quantity, and condition of the asbestos, and frequency of exposure by single individuals. If asbestos is identified or suspected, appropriate control measures must be implemented to reduce the exposure risk to a level that is ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable). Commanders, managers, and APs must ensure that all personnel involved in the activity have access to all relevant safety information.

If there is evidence of or suspected fibre release, all personnel must take immediate action to cease work, evacuate, decontaminate, report the incident, and conduct a risk assessment to determine the most appropriate course of action (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 12-13). Additionally, commanders, managers, and APs must make sure that personnel who have or may have been exposed to asbestos complete MOD Form 960 – Personal Record Annotation and pass it to the local Services medical or personnel records centre for inclusion in their personal file (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 12-13).

For operations in overseas locations, commanders and managers should conduct an assessment during the planning stage to identify the presence of asbestos or suspected asbestos and assess the risk of asbestos exposure (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 8-9). If infrastructure or equipment has been provided by another organization, commanders and managers should obtain evidence on the presence and state/condition of asbestos from the providing organization or conduct an assessment as part of the EIH assessment (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 9-10).

Before any activity is conducted that has the potential to disturb ACM (asbestos-containing materials), a workplace risk assessment must be completed by a competent person to identify control measures and develop a written plan of work (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 10-11). Commanders, managers, and APs must ensure that control measures identified in the AMP(s), workplace risk assessments, and written plans of work are implemented and that personnel have the ability and resources to comply with the instructions provided (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 36.pdf, pages 11).

Therefore, to know if your workplace has asbestos, a suitable and sufficient workplace risk assessment must be completed by a competent person. If asbestos is identified or suspected, appropriate control measures must be implemented to reduce the exposure risk to a level that is ALARP, and all personnel involved in the activity must have access to all relevant safety information.

In BF(G), families should be aware that ‘Dangerous Dog’ legislation is applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany. German legislation contains special requirements to be met covering both dogs and owner before permission is given for the animal to remain in the country. For other countries occupants should enquire about local laws prior to moving. In order to keep a pet in SFA, the occupant is required to seek written permission (Annex B to MOD F1132 – SFA application form) from the IPHD/GSO/SSO overseas at each duty station before acquiring the pet/bringing the pet into the SFA.

This chapter does not cover animals used in the management of Defence business (e.g. police dogs, regimental mascots, ceremonial duties) or on working farms. 2. There is no specific legislation relating to the keeping or bringing of pet animals into the workplace, although the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act does require the employer to ensure the safety, health and welfare, so far as is reasonably practicable, of its personnel and others. 3. Defence recognises that there are both positive and negative aspects to having animals in the workplace. Some animals can make the workplace a more relaxed environment in which to work and provide companionship for staff working alone; however, some people may find they increase stress, find them intimidating or find the smell offensive etc. 4. As a general principle, Defence does not support the bringing of pet animals into the workplace; where it is allowed, bringing them into the workplace is a privilege, and Defence personnel must treat it as such. 5""  ', '']"

Calibration. WBGT monitors require annual calibration to remain accurate. Calibration is undertaken by Defence Electronics & Components Agency (DECA). It is the responsibility of the holding organisation to ensure that the WBGT remains in date for calibration and it is also their responsibility to contact DECA to request this service. Monitors are to be dispatched to DECA5 and accompanied with a MOD Form 1773 ‘Request for Calibration’. Turn-around time is routinely 14 days from the date DECA receive monitors, but a quicker Urgency of Need can be requested on the Form 1773. For queries relating to items sent for calibration, the DECA Helpdesk can be contacted on: tepl.helpdesk@deca.mod.uk or 01244 847365 / 95541 7365. Wherever possible, organisations should arrange for calibration to occur over the cooler months of the year in order to maximise availability of WBGT during the period when risk of thermal stress is highest.

The heat illness risk planning tool and its associated tables in Annex A illustrate how to consider heat illness in the five-step risk assessment process. The following factors must be considered as part of that process. a. Acclimatisation. The risk of heat illness in hot climates (dry or humid) can be reduced, but not eliminated, by acclimatisation. All personnel performing an activity in the UK or Northern Europe must be considered as not acclimatised because the climate is temperate with only occasional heatwaves. Acclimatisation may not be possible for tasks carried out at short notice or for limited periods (for example, for air travel from a temperate to a hot climate) or if long periods are spent in air-conditioned buildings. Guidance on acclimatisation is given in Annex E. b. Clothing and equipment. Clothing affects a person’s ability to shed excess heat and, along with carrying equipment, may put extra strain on the body. Particular attention is needed when an activity requires the use of specialist clothing or equipment (for example, waterproofs, body armour, ceremonial dress, firefighting equipment, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) suits or Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) suits). Clothing must be carefully considered to make sure that it is appropriate for the activity and can be adjusted as required (for example, by removing layers of clothing). c.

1. Remove the casualty from the cold environment and provide shelter and dry clothing.
2. Warm the casualty both generally and their hands and feet.
3. Prevent further cooling by protecting them from wind, rain, and providing insulation.
4. Refer the casualty to a medic for initial assessment and then onto a doctor.
5. Do not allow the casualty to return to the cold environment.
6. During recovery, ensure adequate protection from the cold and regular checks to prevent further injury.
7. If necessary, refer the patient to DPHC NFCI Clinics or Defence Medical Rehabilitation Programme for further assessment and management.
8. Record the incident on DMICP and follow up as appropriate during recovery.

It is important to note that direct heat should not be used, and the affected part should not be allowed to freeze again once warmed (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex E).

Construction of the safety case for an equipment should start as early in the acquisition lifecycle as possible and should be an integrated part of the equipment design, rather than a supplementary activity. As well as providing a justification that the equipment is (or will be) safe to use, the safety case should be an aid to its design and the planning of the acquisition programme. Planning in advance the safety argument that the SRO hopes to be able to make when a system is delivered and used in service should inform the safety requirements for the equipment, and the type of activities that will be necessary in the acquisition programme and during operation to generate the evidence to support the safety case. This information should in turn support decisions such as the choice of supplier and whether to use a bespoke, off-the-shelf or customised design. 17. Safety cases for equipment should be forward-looking and take into account activities beyond normal operation and training. They must also consider how equipment can be manufactured, tested, commissioned, transported, stored, maintained and disposed of safely. Stakeholder input will be required to validate assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other DLODs. Input from human factors specialists is also likely to be required to ensure these activities can be carried out safely and easily.

Where a risk assessment is not sufficient to demonstrate that the risks to the equipment have been adequately identified, communicated and/or controlled, then a safety case must be developed. A safety case is used to provide compelling evidence that equipment is safe for a given application in a given operating environment. A safety case must capture all the safety related risks associated with that equipment and evidence how these risks will be managed to as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level. 15. The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) or the User, is responsible for making sure that a safety case has been produced and that all relevant safety issues have been considered.

Considerations affecting the need for a safety case for an equipment include the following: a. Whether a safety case approach is proportionate given the complexity of the equipment and the level of risk involved, or whether a simple risk assessment would be more appropriate; b.

In  cases of liberation of allied territory, or in cases where troops are sent in to a collapsed state6 to restore law and order, it may not always be possible to  conclude a civil affairs agreement with the authorities of the country con-  cerned in advance so that there will be de facto military rule by the liberating  power.7 The rules of international law applying to occupied territory  should, so far as possible, be applied by analogy until an agreement is con-  cluded. Where a belligerent liberates part of its own territory before normal  civil government can be restored, the extent of the military authorities’  powers is a matter of the domestic law of the belligerent concerned.8  Definition of Occupation  Territory is considered to be occupied when it is actually placed under the""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 383.pdf, page 332: ""vented, the laws in force in the occupied state.12 The law of armed conflict  does not confer power on an occupant.

Therefore, this chapter defines the responsibility of a commander, manager or accountable person as someone who has a delegated managerial or supervisory responsibility for activities or equipment that may result in the exposure of Defence personnel to excessive noise whilst at work. The noise levels must be managed through the use of control measures to reduce exposure to a level that is ALARP and tolerable. This includes design of equipment at the procurement stage to prevent or minimise noise exposure to levels that are ALARP and tolerable. 23. The above definitions imply that there will likely be several individuals who together share responsibility for reducing noise exposure. All personnel have a duty to work together to assess the risks and to make sure Defence is compliant with the policy statements in this chapter and therefore the legislation. 24. Whilst the primary responsibility for the welfare and H&S of personnel rests immediately with the commanders, managers or accountable persons of those personnel, this duty usually cannot be discharged without the proactive actions of other managers or responsible people.

60,What risks are associated with the use of a chemical agent monitor?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 20.pdf, page 6 and 2, the risks associated with the use of a chemical agent monitor include the potential for internal damage leading to the spread of Ni-63 if the source were damaged, and in some highly unlikely circumstances, there is a potential for an internal dose to be received. The undamaged equipment does not present an external radiation hazard during routine use (JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 20.pdf, page 6). It's important to note that further advice should be sought from the Radiation Protection Advisor (RPA) for further information (JSP 392 Part 2 Ch 20.pdf, pages 6 and 2).

67,What are the main features of a bullet catcher constructed from sand?,"According to JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2 (paragraphs 02110-02112), a bullet catcher constructed from sand should meet the following features:

* Sand conforms to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"" and grading should conform to BSI PD 6682-1 Table D1, ""0/4 Concrete Sand CP"" with angular shape for slope stability and sound physical properties.
* The sand profile has to be maintained at an angle of 34° (600 mils) and the depth required to contain a round is 750 mm(S) 500 mm(C) for low velocity weapons, and 1000mm(S) 900 mm(C) for high velocity weapons.
* The sand should not readily breakdown naturally and should not crush to fine dust when rubbed between the hands.

Therefore, a bullet catcher constructed from sand should be made of high-quality sand that meets specific grading requirements, has a consistent angle of 34° (600 mils), and is maintained at the appropriate depth for the type of weapon being used to prevent ricochet or backsplash","['This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2.pdf, page 36: "". 02112. Construction. The core of the bullet catcher or stop butt may be constructed of any stable inert fill material. However, the surface is to be covered by sand as specified in the relevant Chapter for the range. Generally the depth of sand is related to the type of weapon fired. For high velocity weapons (see Table 4), the depth of sand measured on a line parallel to the LofS should be 1000 mm (S) 900 mm (C) For low velocity weapons the depth should also be 750 mm (S) 500 mm (C) in the direction of the line of fire. 02113. Profile. 340 (600 mils) (C) is the recommended slope for the front face of the bullet catcher in order to reduce the risk of ricochet. Rounds impacting into, or the natural settlement of the sand, may reduce the slope which must never be allowed to fall below 300 (530 mils) (C); as this may cause ricochet to leave the RDA. 02114. Maintenance. Regular maintenance of the sand is essential to the range remaining safe for use. There are several factors to be considered and these are described below. Renewal or replacement of the sand may be achieved by rotating the sand in situ or by replacing it with sand from another section of the bullet catcher. The following measures are particularly important. a. Profile. Sand in the bullet catcher is to be raked to prevent tunnelling at the MPI behind targets to keep the surface of the sand in a loose state and to restore the profile to the slope stated in paragraph 02113""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 3.pdf, page 2: ""JSP 403 Volume 2 Indoor Ranges Edition 3 Change 6 0324. The Sand Bullet Catcher. The traditional sand faced bullet catcher is ballistically suitable for all weapons. Details of sand bullet catchers are provided in Chapter 2. It is however not the ideal solution indoors due to the dust and cleaning problems associated with such traps. 0325. Vertical Steel Plate with Anti-Splash Curtain. Existing low velocity ranges traditionally have the minimum requirements outlined in Figure 3-5. In this case the bullet catcher and the backplate are to be firmly fixed to a sound brick, blockwork or concrete wall. Steel plates should be mounted so that sheets are flush to each other, preferably with fixings made flush. The bullet catcher plates should be so arranged that the target positions will not coincide with the edges of the steel sheet. This design is the minimum requirement for rimfire weapons. It is simple and reliable, and breaks up the round on impact. Backsplash is prevented by an anti-splash curtain in front of the plate. A timber batten on the floor behind the curtain helps contain lead fragments. The main disadvantage of this trap is noise and the lead dust generated by bullet impact on the steel plate. The size and thickness of steel plate may be determined from Chapter 2 Tables 6 and 7. To minimise reverberation and noise when the bullet catcher is struck, an absorbent layer should be sandwiched between the steel sheet and the back wall""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 11.pdf, page 10: "". With an open firing point, noise will be a consideration to avoid disturbing resting troops. 1149. Spare CONSTRUCTION 1150. Bullet Catchers. The bullet catcher must stop both direct fire and ricochet. The bullet catcher for improvised ranges may be constructed of local material providing that it is free of stones or rock. There are two options suitable for improvised ranges; a. Sandbag wall / bund. This trap presents a steep (min 56deg) or vertical sand or earth face from which ricochet is not likely. Ricochet off the tube towards the end is a factor that will dictate the height of the vertical face of the stop butt. Clearly the closer the stop butt to the target the better. A canopy may be used to reduce the need for a high stop butt. The problem with this trap is that the MPI will soon be shot out and require repair. A sacrificial front wall of sand bags will avoid the need to rebuild the bund each time. Where steel mesh gabions are used sand bags should be used behind targets to avoid hard ricochet or backsplash (50m) with timber boarding over the remainder of steel exposed to the firer.""

Sand has been generally used in bullet catchers and stop butts on many of the ranges described in this Volume. This section specifies the quality of the sand, its profile and maintenance that are necessary to capture shot without causing ricochet or backsplash. Wet sand will have the tendency to form tunnelling on ranges where tight grouping is expected which may result in penetration of the bullet catcher. 02111. Quality. It is recommended that sand conforming to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"". Grading should conform to BSI PD 6682-1 Table D1, ""0/4 Concrete Sand CP"" with angular shape for slope stability and sound physical properties to resist natural breakdown.\' This grade is fine enough not to cause ricochet yet coarse enough to retain the required profile effectively without likelihood of setting or forming a surface crust; it is also relatively stable in high winds. This specification also provides for a material that will not readily breakdown naturally, such material should not crush to fine dust when rubbed between the hands. Over time bullets pounding the sand reduce it to fine dust behind the MPI, at this point the sand will need to be replaced. 02112. Construction.

The facility may be constructed in any form providing the ballistic safety requirements of this Chapter are met. 3206. Bullet Catcher. The permanent unloading facility normally includes a sand or rubber bullet catcher, details of which are given in Chapter 2. It is essential to safety that the correct grade of sand or rubber is used and maintained in a loose state at an angle of 34º (600 mils). The sand or rubber profile has to be maintained to the levels marked on the facility\'s side and back walls. For low velocity weapons .22 in, 9mm, the depth required to contain a round is 750 mm(S) 500 mm(C), for high velocity weapons the depth should be 1000mm(S) 900 mm(C). The depth can be achieved by elevating the standing position for unloading, so that the barrel is pointed down at an angle into the sand unloading facility. A low velocity bullet catcher must be clearly signed detailing which weapons are permitted. 3207. Cladding. As an additional safety feature, the walls are timber clad, which reduces but does not eliminate danger if struck.""

Traditional sand bank with canopy or 100m Range Danger Area. The traditional sand bullet catcher with a 900 mm depth of sand at 34° (600 mils) is a safe, reliable and proven design. It is safe for automatic fire in short bursts. To capture high angle ricochet and 7.62mm pop over, a canopy of minimum 180mm thick timber (rail sleeper) or steel plate should cover the target area. If there is sufficient space, a 100m RDA may eliminate the requirement for a canopy. Section 2 – Typical bullet trap using sand natural angle of repose (30 – 34deg) 1151. Target Selection. When selecting targets and target mechanisms, the difficulty of moving down the range to mark or change targets should be borne in mind as target retrieval systems cannot easily be installed in the tube. An automatic marking system and a simple turning target mechanism will greatly enhance the range and the training value. Fall-when-hit systems are difficult on a tube range as the concentration of the sound energy in the tube may activate the mechanism without the target being struck. The Figure 11 remains the target of choice for military practices but requires a large diameter tube. Representative targets, sized to give the appearance of targets at greater ranges provide valuable training on shorter ranges. To minimise the risk of ricochet off the tube walls, targets must be presented centrally in the tube""  ', '']"

Blinds. The grenade is relatively small and therefore consideration must be given to locating blinds where there is the potential for a residual hazard with practice rounds. Ranges should be sited in reasonably clear areas where scrub and grass can be effectively managed. For UGL HEDP rounds a Closed Impact Area is normally required. Where the ground is such that the location and clearance of blinds may be guaranteed (RAO Assessment) a controlled impact area may be applied. Attempts should be made to locate the range so that the target is engaged in a depression, thus minimizing the extent of exclusion fence required on closed impact areas.

The impact area must be open to view by the safety supervisors in the throwing bays. The DA should be clear and open to view from the RCO\'s control tower; where this is not possible control measures must be in place which allows the RCO to be confident that the DA is clear.

The constructional details for the grenade range are shown in Figure 22-1. The range was designed for previous issue L2 grenade but is suitable for currently approved L109 Service hand grenades. The standard design includes sloping roofs on the assembly and dispersal buildings with the slope towards the throwing bay to avoid any ponding on the roof. Ponding can enhance the blast effect of grenades thrown onto these roofs and therefore could damage the roof. 2207. Siting. The range buildings and impact area require a reasonably level site as there must be no possibility of a grenade rolling after it lands whether deliberately thrown or accidentally dropped. The range should be sited away from roads and areas frequented by the public. The orientation of the range should be northerly so that the RCO is not looking into the sun.

Introduction. Grenade ranges not conforming to the current criteria for the Basic Grenade Range may be used to train soldiers in tactical grenade training, but only when the range conforms to the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2218 and 2219. The Exercise Director and Exercise Planning Staff are to ensure the use of any constructed tactical grenade facility is safe for the practices to be undertaken and sufficient protection is provided for both exercising troops and safety staff. CONSTRUCTION 2218. Field Firing Area Tactical Grenade Range. Tactical grenade practices do not necessarily require a constructed range as suitable natural cover may be used. However, an example of construction for a semi-permanent tactical throwing grenade trench is shown in Figure 22-2 with grenade posting trenches shown in Figures 22-3 to 22-5.

The range floor for a four lane IBSR requires an area 350 m long by 100 m wide. Sufficient space is required behind the start line for troops to assemble and for the range control building. The range is best sited on ground that is relatively level over the first 100 m, rising over the remainder of its length and preferably to some distance beyond. The QE from any point of engagement must not exceed 150 mils (8.50). Bush and shrub growth should remain in a natural state with non-ricochet inducing obstacles providing cover for fire and movement skills. Care is required to ensure that the most distant targets are not silhouetted on the skyline. A well drained site is essential as target mechanisms have to be dug in.

A Full Danger Area (FDA) range is an open range where the hazard is limited by the elevation of the delivery system and the skill of the firer. The amount of land or sea danger area required is minimised by controlling the elevation of the weapon. c. Limited Danger Area Range. A Limited Danger Area (LDA) range is an open range for which the minimum design requirements are to capture direct shot and any resultant ricochet remains within the RDA. A combination of limiting elevation and the inclusion of range structures to capture shot and or minimise ricochet enables the danger area to be further reduced. d. No Danger Area Range.

69,How do I prevent blinds on a UGL range?,"To prevent blinds on a UGL (Under-Barrel Grenade Launcher) range, the following measures can be taken based on the provided reference text:

1. Construct the bank clear of the steel plate to ensure blinds can be dealt with safely and bury it up to 150 mm below the surface or build up the surface to achieve the same protection (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 28, p. 3).
2. Prepare the area around the target to minimize problems in locating blinds. For targets located 150m or more from the firing point, a prepared area should be sufficient (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 28, p. 3).
3. Angle any baffles within the backsplash distance of a firing point to prevent backsplash and ensure that strike will ricochet down-range and not towards walls or roof (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 3, p. ).
4. Maintain the range in reasonably clear areas where scrub and grass can be effectively managed, and consider a Closed Impact Area for UGL HEDP rounds if the ground allows for guaranteed location and clearance of blinds (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 28, p. ).
5. Inspect the range regularly for damage and debris, keep the impact area surface levelled, and remove any displaced or degraded aggregate (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 22, p. 4).
6. Keep grass and vegetation in the RDA (Range Danger Area) extending at least 20m around the impact area short to enable RCOs to locate and clear any blinds landing wide of the prepared impact area (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 22, p. 4).

UGL Target Area. To minimize the problems of locating blinds, the area around the target may be prepared to ensure detonation. For targets located 150m or more from the firing point a prepared area, illustrated in Figure 28-4 should be sufficient. A prepared area is one where all soft earth, reed and tall grass has been removed. In peaty areas imported stone or gravel will provide an adequate initiation surface. Imported stone or gravel should not contain large (> 30 mm) stone behind which blinds may lodge. 2811. Initiating Stop Butt. On ranges where depressed L of S with ground behind the target cannot be achieved, initiating stop butts may be constructed to capture rounds that miss the target. The dimensions of the initiating stop butt should be determined by the assessment of the RCO\'s ability to observe potential blinds that may fall behind the initiating stop butt.

Certain items of maintenance are essential to the safe operation of the range. These are: (a) After each period of live training, the range structure is to be inspected for damage, particularly walls facing the impact area and the tower structure. Binoculars can assist in the latter. (b) Gravel in the throwing and priming bays must be raked level and the height of the front wall kept at 1.35 m. It will require occasional topping up with fresh single sized 20 mm aggregate. (c) The impact area surface has to be levelled and any displaced aggregate graded back into place. Aggregate that has broken down is to be removed and replaced with fresh aggregate. Aggregate displacement and degradation is usually caused by blinds being destroyed rather than thrown grenades detonating. (d) Debris is not to be allowed to accumulate on any part of the range.

It is recommended to consult the latest edition of relevant legislation or Environmental Protection Advisers before disposing of environmental protection records (JSP 418 Leaflet 11.odt, page 0, paragraphs 14 and 15).

Therefore, an answer to this question has been found in the provided reference text, but it is not a definitive answer as the retention period for environmental protection records depends on various factors.

The Northern Ireland Environment Agency was launched in 2008 and is an Executive Agency within the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland. 4""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 418 Part 1.pdf, page 9: "". One of the principal regulations in England and Wales is the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) (2010). EPR provides a consolidated framework for environmental permits and exemptions covering industrial activities, waste operations and water discharge activities amongst others. EPR also sets out the powers, functions and duties of the regulators4. In Scotland and Northern Ireland the principle permitting regulations are the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) Regulations. Devolved Administrations 9. Unlike Defence, which is a reserved matter, environment is a devolved power and the Devolved Administrations have the right to bring forward their own environmental protection legislation. Within the UK there are four differing regulatory regimes for environmental protection; the differences can be subtle but the impact of non-compliance maybe significant. Defence operates throughout the UK and needs to be aware of the differing requirements in each of the four UK territories to ensure we are compliant in meeting differing statutory requirements5. Defence Regulations 10. Defence Regulators provide regulation of EP for Defence activities where this is a Departmental responsibility. Defence regulators are empowered by SofS by Charter (DG MAA) or via a delegation from PUS and Director DSEA (DSEA Regulators). Defence regulators operate regimes that are aligned, where reasonably practicable, with statutory equivalents or near equivalents""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 102: "". Environmental legislation therefore focuses on the environmental effects of FLAP pollution on water sources. 14. It is policy that, within the UK, the MOD will comply with Environmental law and any additional requirements arising from international treaties and protocols to which the UK is a signatory. Overseas, the MOD will apply UK standards where reasonably practicable and in addition, comply with relevant host nations’ standards. Where the MOD has been granted specific exemptions, disapplication or derogations from legislation, international treaties or protocols, Departmental standards and arrangements are to be introduced which will be, so far as reasonably practicable, at least as good as those required by the legislation. It is UK Government Policy that the polluter pays. 15. The environmental policy lead on pollution legislation is detailed JSP 418, Part 2, Vol 2, Leaflet 02 -The MOD Sustainable Development and Environment Manual. JSP 418 is framed to ensure activities of the MOD are conducted in compliance with the law and international conventions. However, JSP 418 does not provide specialist guidance on the prevention and clean-up of oil pollution. This JSP has been notified as the lead for such matters and it is the purpose of this Part of JSP 317 to provide suitable guidance.

Defence regulators’ requirements can range from the requirement to submit an exemption case for consideration and approval to a simple requirement that TLB/TFAs have systems and processes in place to manage an environmental protection requirement. 9. Defence regulators may also take account of compliance with statutory requirements as part of their permissioning of activities e.g. DSEA – Fuels and Gases Safety Regulator (FGSR) licensing of fuel installactions. For further information on Defence regulators requirements please see their specific Level 2 JSPs. Overseas Authorities 10. Notwithstanding the position of state immunity under customary international law, many host nations have environmental protection authorities with expectations (which maybe expressed in written agreements) in respect of UK defence activities conducted in their jurisdiction. A Commanding Officer or manager should be fully aware of such agreements and the environmental protection requirements placed on defence when undertaking their activities. Enforcement Statutory Regulators 11. Statutory regulators have enforcement powers and regimes granted to them by legislation. Where an allegedly offending defence activity is conducted by Crown servants i.e. members of the armed forces or MOD civilians, statutory regulators powers can be modified to take account of that fact. 12""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 418 Leaflet 3.odt, page 0: ""Each Defence Organisation or Executive Agency: In line with the Secretary of State’s Policy Statement; it is the responsibility of the Accountable Persons, Commanding Officers and Heads of Establishments for ensuring organisational structures and management arrangements are in place to manage HS&EP for their activities. This will include ensuring compliance with all relevant legislation for waste management and meeting Duty of Care obligations. In many cases the responsibility for the provision and management of site waste management services and facilities is transferred out to Industry Partners as part of Contractual Waste arrangements for Infrastructure or Equipment. In cases where the management of waste has been delegated the delegator must ensure their duty of care is still being met.

In order to achieve this, all personnel must be confident that, not only will they be treated fairly, but also that their families will be treated properly and that Service veterans and their dependants will be respected and appropriately supported. The provision of high-quality subsidised accommodation is a fundamental part of the overall package for Service personnel. However, over time MOD’s accommodation charging system – the 4-Tier Grading (4TG) regulations - has become increasingly complex and out-of-date, meaning many of our properties are incorrectly or inconsistently graded. As part of the New Employment Model (NEM), the Combined Accommodation Assessment System (CAAS) was introduced on 1 April 2016 for Service Families Accommodation (SFA) in the UK and overseas, with Single Living Accommodation (SLA) scoping the option to change pending an update to all SLA using the current 4TG.

86,How are investment decisions made within the MOD?,"Investment decisions within the MOD involve evaluating all costs and benefits associated with a project using the standard 'Investment Appraisal' approach, which includes discounting to obtain its overall Net Present Value (NPV) (JSP 507 Part 2, page 177, introduction). However, in an environment characterized by significant technological challenges and a continually evolving user requirement, Real Options Analysis is used to add value by providing a framework for quantifying the cost of additional flexibility in a project (JSP 507 Part 2, page 177, points 2-3). Factors considered include the remaining period of equipment service, planned future utilization, spares consumption or Mean Time Between Failure rates, current levels of free stock, and other significant factors such as potential alternative suppliers or innovative support packages (JSP 507 Part 1, page 33). The overriding objective is to provide defence outputs offering best value for money affordable to the taxpayer (JSP 507 Part 1, page 35).

In making investment decisions, consideration should be given to the potential impact on MOD employees inside and outside the project boundary, and Trade Unions must be kept informed and consulted as appropriate (JSP 507 Part 1, page 37). The process of determining the appropriate scope involves setting clear objectives, ensuring a fully defined and robust scope, considering all options to meet the requirement including in-house options, undertaking a risk assessment, and achieving the best value for money outcome within available funding (JSP 507 Part 1, page 35).

This can create problems in an environment characterised by significant technological challenges and a continually evolving user requirement in response to the changing threat. In such an environment, decision makers understandably place a premium on maintaining as much flexibility as possible. Introduction 1. The standard ‘Investment Appraisal’ approach involves capturing all of the costs and benefits associated with a project and then discounting them to obtain its overall Net Present Value (NPV). Implicit in this approach is a static one-time decision making process, which means that although the costs and benefits associated with a particular decision may be subject to uncertainty; once a decision has been made it is taken as given. 2. Although this method is more than adequate for evaluating a wide range of investment decisions, it has been demonstrated that it systematically undervalues approaches which allow for decisions to be altered or reversed in response to changing conditions in an uncertain environment. In these circumstances, Real Options Analysis can add value because it provides a framework for quantifying whether the cost of additional flexibility in a project represents value for money (by capturing it explicitly within the project’s NPV). 3""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 507 Part 1.pdf, page 37: ""a. the remaining period the equipment is expected to remain in service; b. the planned future utilisation of the main equipment and how this differs from past experience; c. spares consumption or Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rates; d. current levels of free stock; e. stock return trends. 33.

At the early stages of a project, an assessment of risks associated with each option must be made, and optimism bias should be considered as a risk (37). As the business case develops, a more detailed assessment of individual risks and risk management will be required for larger projects, and an optimism bias assessment can then be used as a ""sanity check"" of the risk assessment (39). For small projects, the risk premium may continue to be encompassed by a general uplift to offset and allow for optimism bias. Sensitivity analysis should also be conducted to test the vulnerability of options to future uncertainties and plausible variations to assumptions made (40).

Therefore, managing the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates involves making an explicit allowance for optimism bias in the assessment of risks at the early stages of a project or policy. A more detailed assessment of individual risks and risk management is required for larger projects, and sensitivity analysis should be conducted to test the vulnerability of options to future uncertainties.

There is always likely to be some difference between what is expected, as reflected in an appraisal, and what eventually happens. This is due to biases inherent in the appraisal, and risks and uncertainties that materialise. As a result, risk management strategies should be adopted for the appraisal and implementation of all policies, programmes or projects. 2. An appraisal should take proportionate account of risks and uncertainties in the estimates of costs and benefits. The components of an appraisal should be presented in a way that allows the most important risks and uncertainties to be readily appreciated. It can sometimes be helpful to quote the value that a key quantity would have to take to alter the ranking of options. Appraisal should also assess the risks and uncertainties associated with factors that have not been valued in monetary terms. Definitions 3. In the context of appraisals, the following definitions are usually applied: a.

This process is also referred to as ‘mobilisation’ and serves as the primary mechanism for reservists to undertake military operations or other authorised military tasks. 2. For the purposes of this JSP, mobilisation is the process by which an individual reservist, or group of reservists, is brought into permanent service.

To retain the support of employers and the ability to mobilise reservists for priority tasks, taking into account that there are limits on the duration of permanent service within set periods, reservists should not routinely be mobilised solely to conduct training, professional / personal development activities, or provide training support which is not directly related to operations. Such activities should be undertaken under Sections 22, 24, 25 or 27 of RFA 96.

Deployment consists of the operational tour (or authorised task), R&R if applicable, Recovery, Decompression and Normalisation activity prior to their release from service. h. Demobilisation. Demobilisation is the process used to formally release the reservist from their period of permanent service and includes normal J1/4 checks to ensure that there are no outstanding issues before a reservist is released on Annual Leave or Post Operational Leave (AL/POL). The period of leave ends on the last day of permanent service. Employers receive notice of the release of the reservist and their last day of permanent service, to facilitate their return to work and to conform with the Safeguard of Employment Act 1985.

With the exception of HRR and SRs, the majority of Reserves will not routinely be held at higher than medium readiness (R6 and above) for tasks or contingent operations.

Rapid field rewarming of frostbite. Field rewarming by warm water bath immersion can and should be performed if the proper equipment and methods are available and definitive care is more than 2 hours away. Field rewarming should only be undertaken if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until the patient arrives at definitive care. (1)  Water should be heated to between 37-39°C. If a thermometer is not available, a safe water temperature can be determined by placing an uninjured  hand in the water for at least 30 seconds to confirm that the water temperature is tolerable and will not cause burn injury.  (2)  The affected limb should be suspended in circulating water. Because the water may cool after the rewarming process is started, the water should be continually, but carefully, warmed to the target temperature.

96,What is the difference between VOLSEP and INVOLSEP?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 752.pdf (pages 31, 35), the main difference between Voluntary Separated (VOLSEP) and Involuntary Separated (INVOLSEP) status is the reason for separation from immediate family. VOLSEP applies when a Service person is separated from their family voluntarily, such as when they choose to wait for Service Families Accommodation (SFA) or are seconded to a host country and receive emoluments directly from that country. INVOLSEP status, on the other hand, applies when a Service person is separated from their immediate family due to Service reasons beyond their control, such as overseas assignments of 12 months or less, being assigned to a different location from their spouse/civil partner, or waiting to occupy SFA that has been refused.

If the reservist has agreed on a return-to-work date with their former employer and is happy with the terms of employment, no further action is required. However, if the reservist has not been offered a job they are happy with by the end of their mobilised service, they must formally write to their employer stating when they are available to return to work within the next 21 days (JSP 532.pdf, page 6).

Additionally, JSP 753 Part 2.pdf (page 44) states that on demobilisation, there are certain activities that need to take place, including providing a medical examination prior to the cessation of permanent service and completing a demobilisation certificate. The reservist should be reminded of the provisions of the Reserves Mental Health Programme as well (JSP 753 Part 2.pdf, paragraph 14).

Therefore, as the line manager of a mobilised reservist, you need to ensure that your reservist completes these demobilisation activities and communicates with their employer regarding their return to work.

Reserve Forces provide an integral component of the UK Defence capability, as part of the Whole Force1. Provision is made with respect to the Reserve Forces by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96), as amended by the Armed Forces Act 2006 (AFA 06) and the Defence Reform Act 2014 (DRA 14). RFA 96 provides for the call-out and recall of Reserve Forces for permanent service. This process is also referred to as ‘mobilisation’ and serves as the primary mechanism for reservists to undertake military operations or other authorised military tasks. 2. For the purposes of this JSP, mobilisation is the process by which an individual reservist, or group of reservists, is brought into permanent service. Failure to attend for service on call-out without leave lawfully granted or a reasonable justification is an offence under RFA 96. However, reservists and employers have the right to apply for deferral of, or exemption from, a reservist’s liability to be mobilised or, in the case of persons already serving, release or discharge from service. RFA 96 limits the periods for which reservists may be required to serve when mobilised. Once brought into permanent service, reservists attract many of the same rights and benefits as their Regular counterparts. In addition, their civilian employment rights are protected and both the employer and reservist may be entitled to claim financial assistance. 3""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 532.pdf, page 12: ""Is my entitlement to a redundancy payment/package affected by my time on mobilisation?

Defence needs to be able to recruit sufficient, motivated and capable people and to do this it must be able to attract Service People (SP) from across a demographically changing society. As a consequence, “Diversity for Defence” the MOD’s Unified Diversity Strategy, visualises a culture where all people are able to make their distinctive contributions and achieve their full potential. It states that: “Our vision is a workforce, uniformed and civilian, that is drawn from the breadth of the society we defend, that gains strength from that society’s range of knowledge, experience and talent and that welcomes, respects and values the unique contribution of every individual”. Bullying, harassment and discrimination brought about by a lack of ED&I erodes trust and damages operational effectiveness.

105,What death-in-service benefits are members of the reserve forces entitled to?,"Members of the reserve forces are entitled to a tax-free lump sum equivalent to four times their pensionable earnings if they die in service as a member of RFPS 05 (JSP 764 Part 3, page 8, 0411). If they previously left the Armed Forces with an Immediate Pension under AFPS 75 or AFPS 15, they would receive four times their pensionable earnings less the IP lump sum or the pension they have already received (JSP 764 Part 3, page 8, 0411). If a preserved member dies, his deferred pension lump sum will be paid to his nominated recipient(s) (JSP 764 Part 3, page 8, 0412). Additionally, reservists and their employers are entitled to receive financial assistance during periods of mobilisation including the Employer’s Incentive Payment (JSP 753 Part 1, page 45).

Furthermore, if an active member with two years' qualifying service, a deferred member or a pensioner member dies leaving a spouse or civil partner, the surviving spouse or civil partner is entitled to a pension for life (JSP 765.pdf, page 36, 0416).

There are different levels of Bereavement Grant (BG) depending on the status and pension scheme of the reserve personnel. Members of the FTRS, NRPS and non-active members of the RFPS are entitled to £25,000, Reserve members of the AFPS 15 and those who are not members of the RFPS, FTRS or NRPS receive £37,500, while an active member of the RFPS receives £37,500 and a former member of Reserves receives £25,000 (JSP 765.pdf, page 32, 7.12). For reservists where death is caused by service and they are not members of the RFPS 05, FTRS PS or NRPS PS, the BG award is 1½ times the standard BG to recognise the fact that civilian occupational pensions schemes usually have less generous provisions in relation to lump sums payable to dependants on death than that of the RFPS (JSP 765.pdf, page 32, 7.13).

107,How is financial compensation calculated for people made redundant from service?,"The financial compensation for people made redundant from service, also known as Compensation on Redundancy (CLS), is calculated based on their Final Relevant Earnings (FRE) and the length of their completed and uncompleted service. The calculation depends on the specific circumstances of the person's service commitment and whether they have completed sufficient qualifying service to reach their Immediate Pension point.

If a person has insufficient service to qualify for Early Discharge Pay (EDP) or has not reached the EDP 18/40 Point, Paragraph 0216 applies. The CLS is determined by finding the lower of:

(a) FRE/8 x completed years, or
(b) the sum of (1) FRE/8 x each year of uncompleted service, and (2) FRE/8.

If a person has completed 40 years or more of reckonable service, Paragraph 0215 applies, and the CLS is calculated as FRE/4 x uncompleted years.

Additionally, people made redundant may be entitled to other benefits such as an Immediate Pension (monthly pension and pension lump sum) or a Preserved Pension (monthly pension and pension lump sum) at age 60/65, depending on whether they have completed sufficient qualifying service.

The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) provides compensation for injury or illness caused or made worse by service; or where death is caused by service in the UK Armed Forces on or after 6 April 2005. The Scheme applies equally to Regular and Reserve forces. Compensation is paid for injuries2 which arise as a result of service, regardless of how they are sustained. No distinction is made between injuries sustained on operations, and those incurred during training, service-approved sport (see JSP 660), or while undertaking specified activities to maintain fitness. Recognising that members of the Armed Forces do not generally choose where they deploy and what activities they undertake as part of their service, the compensation scheme covers this wide spectrum of activities the Armed Forces undertake. 1.2. The AFCS is a no-fault scheme and is therefore different from awards for damages paid through the courts. If an individual believes they have been injured as a result of negligence, having an AFCS award does not prevent them from bringing a claim through the common law damages route, although an AFCS award would be taken into account in the damages payment (or vice versa).

These are: • When an individual is medically discharged, and has been considered eligible for an ill-health pension, DBS will automatically consider the principal medical condition leading to medical discharge to determine whether it is caused by service and therefore warrants an AFCS award. This will not happen if the individual already has an AFCS award for that condition or made an unsuccessful claim for an AFCS award for that condition.

The Defence Safety Management System (SMS) is the system by which all Defence organisations manage the interrelated parts of their business in order to conduct and manage activities safely. Each Defence organisation is expected to develop and maintain an organisational SMS that reflects their activities and support the Defence vision for Safety. Each organisational SMS should relate back to this overarching policy document. 2. Responsibility for the management of health, safety, and environmental protection (HS&EP) is derived from the Secretary of State for Defence’s (SofS) Policy Statement. The SofS Policy Statement sets out the commitment and role of the Defence organisations senior leaders to ensure that safety policies and regulations are applied throughout Defence and that their Defence activities are delivered in line with the Defence Safety Management Systems (SMS) and their own Organisational SMS. 3. The amplification of the SofS Policy Statement is contained in Defence policy for Health Safety and Environmental Protection (HS&EP) which also sets out the general Organisation and Arrangements (O&A) for Defence to manage HS&EP.

113,What is the difference between OPCOM and TACOM?,"According to the provided reference text, Operational Command (OPCOM) and Tactical Command (TACOM) are two different types of military command authorities. OPCOM refers to the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, deploy units, and retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as necessary. It is the authority to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned and does not include responsibility for administration or logistics (Annex A, JSP 815 Vol 2, page 5). On the other hand, TACOM refers to the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. It is the detailed local direction and control of movement or maneuver necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks (Annex A, JSP 815 Vol 2, page 5). The main difference between OPCOM and TACOM lies in their scope: OPCOM deals with operational-level command and control, while TACOM deals with tactical-level command and control.

OPCON is the authority delegated to a commander to direct assigned forces so that they may accomplish their specific missions or tasks, usually limited by function, time, or location, to deploy units concerned and to retain or assign tactical control to those units. OPCON allows a commander to issue missions and tasks to subordinates, within the scope of the mission issued by higher authority4. It does not include the authority to assign separate employment of components of the units concerned. Nor does it include administrative or logistic control. c. Tactical Command (TACOM). TACOM is the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. d. Tactical Control (TACON). TACON is the detailed local direction and control of movement, or manoeuvre which is necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks. 1-42. Control and Coordination Terms. The following terms may be ascribed independently to operational and tactical command states to delegate elements of authority: a. Administrative Control (ADCON). ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organisations in respect of administrative matters such as personnel management, supply, services and other issues not included in the operational mission of the subordinate or other organisations. Therefore, ADCON is assigned separately to a given command state. b""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 815 Vol 2 Annex A.pdf, page 4: "". Control at too high a level can result in a loss of flexibility and tempo. Conversely, command at too low a level can result in the inability to concentrate resources and will hamper the ability to rapidly switch priorities. 1-40. Full Command (FULLCOM). FULLCOM is the military authority and responsibility of a commander to issue orders to subordinates. It covers every aspect of military operations and administration and exists only within national Services. The term \'command\', as used internationally, implies a lesser degree of authority than when it is used in a purely national sense. No NATO or coalition commander has FULLCOM over the assigned forces of other nations. Only OPCOM or OPCON (see below) can be delegated across national lines. 1-41. Operational and Tactical Command States: a. Operational Command (OPCOM). OPCOM is the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units and to reassign forces and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as may be necessary.

Consequently, Defence must ensure that its Training Systems meet the very highest standards. Training must also be robust, realistic and challenging if it is to prepare its personnel for the full spectrum of Defence Roles. However, there is a tendency, because of the risk, for Defence training organisations to provide more training than necessary in the misguided belief that this will make up for future uncertainties. And, in some cases, poorly designed or executed Training Systems can deliver insufficient training. The ideal then is a Training System that is designed to train its personnel to an optimal level so that they are equipped with the appropriate Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA). Providing too much training costs money that will likely be taken from elsewhere in the training budget that could then result in insufficient training in other areas, which risks lives.

118,How can I identify people who are at risk of exertional collapse?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf on page 31, individuals who may be at risk of exertional collapse have various personal and environmental/external risk factors. Personal risk factors include dehydration, recent or current illness (including raised temperature), recent vaccination, poor baseline conditioning/fitness level, excess body fat, prior poor fitness test performance, prior exercise-related collapse, accumulated fatigue, an underlying cardiac condition, asthma, and sickle cell trait. Environmental and external risk factors include lack of appropriate environmental acclimatisation (including heat, cold, and altitude), exercise at altitude, high ambient temperature and humidity, cold weather, certain medications, and dietary supplements containing stimulants. Additionally, an individual's motivation or peer/command pressure is also important to recognize as a risk factor (JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, pages 31-32).

Therefore, individuals who exhibit any of these risk factors should be identified and monitored closely during physical activity to prevent exertional collapse. It's essential to prioritize early recognition and intervention, including immediate cessation of the physical activity for all participants and timely treatment (JSP 822 Vol 4.pdf, page 31).

An individual who is poorly performing or demonstrates distress during, or immediately after physical exercise, may be at risk of exertional collapse, and potentially even death. Poor performance and distress must be recognised early to enable timely intervention, including immediate cessation of the physical activity for all participants. Priority must be given to treating the individual. A dynamic risk assessment should consider whether others participating in the same activity are also at risk and whether the activity can safely resume. 16. Risk factors associated with exercise-related collapse can be personal, environmental, or external and recognised risk factors are listed below, noting this is not an exhaustive list: a. Personal risk factors include: • Dehydration. • Recent or current illness (include raised temperature). • Recent vaccination (within 24 hours). • Poor baseline conditioning/fitness level. • Excess body fat. • Prior poor fitness test performance. • Prior exercise related collapse. • Accumulated fatigue. • An underlying cardiac condition. • Asthma. • Sickle Cell Trait (SCT). Clinical evidence suggests that these individuals may be more prone to injury (or death) with physical exertion. b.

After admission of the offence, the range of punishment is similar but with lower levels of restriction, fines, and detention (3-7 days for AWOL and 28 days for Deserter). It's important to note that seeking legal advice prior to awarding punishment is advisable due to the infrequent use of this offence.

Disciplinary Award of AWOL is an absence type which can be selected and implemented retrospectively, by the Unit HR Administration staff only, to cover the period that a Service person has been away from their place of duty without the appropriate authorisation. The decision on what is deemed to be ‘appropriate authorisation’ falls to the discretion of the Service person’s CO. 17.17. Disciplinary Award of AWOL can be selected only when a Service person has returned to duty following a period of Unauthorised Absence irrespective of whether that return to duty has been voluntary or involuntary. The Service person must then be found guilty of an offence of AWOL or Desertion83 before a Disciplinary Award AWOL is selected. 17.18.

For the most part, the question of any time limits only arises where the individual has ceased to be subject to Service law or a civilian subject to Service discipline at the time it is intended to charge them. This will be the case: where a regular Service person has left the Service; where a reservist has ceased to be a member of a reserve force; where a civilian is no longer subject to Service discipline because, for example, they is no longer present in an area that resulted in them becoming subject to Service discipline. However, in relation to a small category of offences there are time limits that apply, which are unrelated to whether or not the individual was or is subject to Service law, or to whether they was a civilian subject to Service discipline, see paragraph 72 below.

132,What types of supplements can I use?,"According to the provided reference text from JSP 835.pdf, dietary supplements that contribute to the nutritional needs of the body by providing significant amounts of carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, or trace elements fall into this category (JSP 835.pdf, page 40). Such products may include fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks, and protein shakes. These supplements are unlikely to lead to a positive CDT if they are responsibly sourced and used as directed (JSP 835.pdf, page 40). However, it is important to note that not all supplements are necessary in a normal military lifestyle, and current advice from the Defence Nutrition Advisory Service (DNAS) is that members of the UK military do not need to take dietary supplements as they can obtain the necessary energy and nutrient intake from eating a regular and balanced diet (JSP 835.pdf, page 36).

Additionally, there are some supplements that may enhance performance when used in accordance with current evidence under the guidance of a well-informed professional and using MOD approved supporting guidance (JSP 835.pdf, page 42). Suitable professionals include registered nutritionists, registered dieticians, and other professionals with recognized expertise in performance-related nutrition. Service personnel should consider the efficacy, cost, risk to health and performance, and potential for a positive CDT before using dietary supplements (JSP 835.pdf, page 42). The use of multiple dietary supplements at one time (stacking) should also be discouraged (JSP 835.pdf, page 42).

It is important to note that not all supplements are created equal, and some may contain contaminants or impurities that can lead to positive CDT outcomes. To ensure the purity of supplements, it is recommended to source them from reputable manufacturers that participate in programs like Informed-Sport (JSP 835.pdf, page 41).

Therefore, the answer to this question depends on the specific circumstances and individual needs of the Service personnel. It is always advisable to consult with a well-informed professional before using any dietary supplements.

Recent studies1 suggest the use of supplements by members of the UK Armed Forces is widespread, and includes trainees, UK-based troops and those preparing to deploy, as well as personnel in operational theatres. Whilst the use of some supplements in certain circumstances can have positive effects, their misuse can have detrimental effects on the health of individuals and could lead to a positive Compulsory Drug Test (CDT) outcome. What are supplements? 2. The term supplement is used to describe a wide range of products ingested by individuals who desire a range of physiological and/or psychological effects from the provision of additional nutrients from the supplement. These nutrients may be absent from the normal daily diet, or may not be consumed in sufficient amounts to achieve ergogenic (performance enhancing) effects. Supplement products often claim to improve health and wellbeing and / or to sustain or improve some aspect of physical or mental performance. A number of products that are marketed as exercise or training supplements, actually contain drugs as part of their composition to increase their efficacy. These drugs include anabolic agents such as anabolic steroids, pro-hormones, peptide hormones and growth factors such as Erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, corticotrophins, and growth hormone. It is therefore important to distinguish between dietary supplements and drugs. 3""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 835.pdf, page 41: "".

The use of dietary supplements in such instances would reduce the risk of developing nutrient deficiencies that could impair both health and performance. 2 HFL Sport Science is an independent drug surveillance laboratory owned by LGC.""

Dietary supplements contribute to the nutritional needs of the body by providing significant amounts of carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, or trace elements, in a form that is readily used by the body. Fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks and protein shakes all fall into this category. Such products may not be generally needed in a normal military life style, but the taking of such dietary supplements is highly unlikely to lead to a positive CDT if they are responsibly sourced and used as directed. 4.

Access to justice. The importance of access to justice for all and the right to legal representation has long been recognised in the UK. To support these principles, a formal legal aid scheme was established to provide publicly funded legal representation e.g. to defend against criminal charges in the magistrates’ and Crown Courts, for those who would otherwise be denied access to justice because they could not afford to pay for it. 2. The underpinning principles. The legal aid scheme is underpinned by the basic principle that those who can afford to pay some or all of their defence costs should do so, whereas those who cannot afford to contribute should receive legal aid support free of charge. Applying this basic principle enables public funds to be used to assist as many people as possible whilst also providing value for money for the taxpayer. As part of this tenet, it follows that, ultimately, the contribution paid by any convicted offender is limited to either their maximum contribution (based upon their personal and financial circumstances at the time of application1) or their actually legally aided costs, whichever is the lower; the maximum contribution includes the full pre-trial income contribution plus any post-trial capital/equity contribution""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 830 Vol 1 Ch 6.pdf, page 53: "".

This process involves the following steps:

1. Identify risks and concerns associated with the design (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).
2. Identify necessary risk mitigation activities to introduce the item (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).
3. Identify required modifications to the design to ensure the equipment is fit for purpose in its military context (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).
4. Identify Human Factors analyses that have been applied during the design and development of the product (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).
5. Focus on non-equipment DLODs such as personnel and training, as the human component may need to adapt to optimize the use of the new equipment (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).
6. Ensure that the equipment can be operated safely and effectively in a range of environments and against various threats (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).
7. Apply Human Factors Integration to defense systems by understanding the role of people in the operation, maintenance, and support of future systems (JSP 912 Part 1, p. 2).

The terms ‘Human Factors (HF)’, ‘Human Factors Engineering (HFE)’ and ‘Human Factors Integration’ are often confused. ‘Human Factors’ refers to a range of disciplines (principally scientific), which relate to the study of human capabilities, limitations, characteristics and behaviour in the broadest possible sense. It includes the study of human interactions with technologies and social interactions and draws on many scientific disciplines, including ergonomics, psychology (and neuropsychology), physiology, biology, anthropometry and biomechanics. It provides the knowledge base from which Human Factors Engineering draws. HFE is concerned with the application of this knowledge in the design, development, assessment, fielding, in-service support and disposal of products – equipment, sub-systems, systems and platforms. In contrast, HFI is a management activity, which includes a systematic process for identifying, tracking and resolving people-related considerations (especially risks and issues), to ensure a balanced development of both technological and human aspects of capability. 2. It is imperative to understand that HFI is more than HFE. It comprises the following five domains: a. Personnel. b. Training. c. Human Factors Engineering. d. System Safety & Health Hazards. e.

Defence Trainers need to be able to inspire, motivate and challenge teams, understand their learning needs and expectations, and be able to draw on the right tools and techniques to get the very best from them. To be fully effective, trainers should therefore understand and fulfil both the Roles of the specialist trainer and that of leader, which include: a. Role modelling. Through the adoption and promotion of the Service core values, trainers lay the foundations for the behaviours that build team cohesion and underpin operational effectiveness. Role modelling is therefore a core responsibility. b""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 939 Part 1.pdf, page 1: ""JSP 939 Defence Policy for Modelling & Simulation (M&S) Part 1: Directive""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 939 Part 2.pdf, page 6: ""Introduction 1. This JSP has been developed to define the Defence Policy for M&S. As described in Part 1, a set of Defence Modelling and Simulation Coherence (DMaSC) Rules have been designed to help provide coherence and governance for M&S enablers across the Defence Enterprise. 2. The DMaSC Rules specify how compliance with the DMaSC vision will be achieved, providing coherency and consistency with improvements in efficiency and effectiveness for M&S enablers across Defence. These rules lay down how these M&S enablers are to be developed and assists decision makers at all levels in understanding the risk and impact of new, modified or enhanced M&S enablers. 3. This JSP Part 2 provides guidance in ensuring maximum ability to interoperate between simulation systems, and between simulation systems and real systems (such as C4I), to enable force elements to train as they operate. It will also promote the sharing and re-use of assets across Defence in accordance with Systems of Systems Approach (SOSA) Principles. 4. The scope and application of this DMaSC Ruleset will continue to evolve in line with the following: a. The scope of DMaSC addresses only the M&S Equipment and Interoperability DLoDs. b. Work to develop the DMaSC domain using SOSA principles (as defined in JSP 906) will inform the future scope of DMaSC based on an analysis of the Issues Risks and Opportunities (IROs) across Defence and what resource will be required to manage these IROs. 5""  ', 'This passage is from JSP 822 Vol 3.pdf, page 4: ""7 Defence Direction for the Defence Trainer Capability in Collective Training Direction Sponsor: TSLD, CDP House of Commons Defence Committee (HCDC) Inquiries, audit reports and research provide evidence that safety in training must remain paramount, with risks reduced to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) and tolerable.

The MOD must apply principles of proportionality, equal treatment, non-discrimination, and transparency when establishing the criteria for tender evaluation, as enshrined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (PCR) or Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR), and must demonstrate value for money. The evaluation strategy cannot be based on lowest price if the Competitive Dialogue procedure is being followed. If MEAT is chosen, the tender with the highest technical score will be judged as the Most Economically Advantageous Tender when two or more tenders have the same cost (JSP 507 Part 1.pdf, page 43, paragraphs 64-66; JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, page 9, paragraphs 13-15). Additionally, tender assessments may involve evaluating individual Tenderer’s Quality Management (QM) controls and conducting sensitivity analysis to ensure various permutations of tenders do not distort the result or produce unexpected outcomes (JSP 940 Part 2.pdf, page 50, paragraphs 38-39; JSP 912 Part 2.pdf, page 29, paragraph 57)","['This passage is from JSP 507 Part 1.pdf, page 40: "".

148,How does damage control surgery differ from in-theatre surgery?,"Damage Control Surgery (DCS) and In-Theatre Surgery are two different surgical interventions with distinct purposes and timelines. DCS is a range of surgical interventions aimed at halting deterioration of the patient's physiological condition rather than attempting definitive restoration of function, and it should be provided within 1 to 2 hours of wounding (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 10 & 13). In contrast, In-Theatre Surgery consists of several surgical procedures spread over a period of time and may require the movement of patients between Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within a theatre of operations. It is delayed until various physiological parameters have been restored to as close to normal as possible and can only occur within a DHC unit (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 23 & 13).

Malaria remains a disease of global and historical importance. It is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. In 2015/16, there was an estimated 212 million cases of malaria with 429,000 deaths worldwide. 90% of cases and 92% of deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.6 Malaria is a disease of military significance, with the outbreak amongst UK troops in Sierra Leone in 2000 generating attack rates of 10% in certain groups.7 The British Armed Forces have been largely successful in mitigating the threat from malaria. Between October 2014 and November 2015, 1530 individuals were deployed on Operation GRITROCK during the British military response to the outbreak of Ebola viral haemorrhagic fever in West Africa.8 During this period there were only seven cases of malaria and UK Armed Forces have not experienced an operationally related death from malaria since 1992.9 10. The prevention of malaria is based upon four principles: a. Awareness of risk. b. Bite prevention. c. Chemoprophylaxis. d. Diagnose promptly and treat without delay.
