1. Make the installation safe electrically, mechanically, and to the environment (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).
2. Consult with the TLB for agreement to decommission and inform FGSR (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).
3. Decide whether to re-commission the facility or permanently decommission it (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).
4. For permanently decommissioned installations, conduct a Land Quality Assessment and create a works budget reflecting the costs and completion date (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).
5. Inform .gov.uk and LEIDOS-CSS-TVS-SCC02@mod.gov.uk for cessation of bulk LPG/LPX deliveries and removal of leased assets (JSP 319 Part 1.odt, page 0).
6. If the installation is unsuitable for loading aviation grade fuels due to FAME content of 15% or more, follow the change of grade procedures outlined in JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 289.
7. During decommissioning, take measures to prevent product loss and off-site risks (JSP 317 Part 2.pdf, page 291).
8. Follow the procedures outlined in JSP 317 Part 1.pdf for declaring a fuel installation redundant before decommissioning it (JSP 317 Part 1.pdf, page 49).

If the family retains official dependent status in the overseas command or the Service parent continues to serve or be employed on the establishment of the overseas Command, the child is entitled to a place in a MOD school during periods when the Service parent is temporarily assigned to another location (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 15). Children attending MOD schools overseas will normally move with their families and continue their education at the new location (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 18). However, if parents elect to deliver home education overseas, they must inform their local Command/Commander/Head of Establishment and take on full responsibility for all costs of education including transport, additional educational support, and reasonable adjustments (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 21). Parents are strongly recommended to research education provision overseas in their prospective assignment location and engage with CEAS at the earliest opportunity (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, pages 4 and 5). If a child is unable to attend a MOD school due to specific care and education provision not being accessible in the location, parents may need to consider other options such as non-MOD schools or home education, but they must ensure that any decision to provide education for their child at home instead of school is consistent with local laws (JSP 342 Part 1.pdf, page 20).

0,,,,,,,How do I test the fit of respiratory protective equipment?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, there are two methods for undertaking fit testing for respiratory protective equipment (RPE): qualitative fit testing (QLFT) and quantitative fit testing (QNFT). QLFT relies on the wearer's senses to determine if there is a gap in the seal between the RPE and their face by the detection of a sweet or bitter aerosol, while QNFT uses various techniques to measure the quantity of leakage into the facepiece. The fit tester should explain the test procedure to the wearer and verbally confirm the findings before conducting the fit test (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, page 13). RPE fit testing must be conducted by a competent person having adequate knowledge, instruction, and training in examining RPE, training a wearer how to correctly fit a facepiece, and performing a wearer pre-use fit check (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, page 13). Fit test records must be made available to the wearer and to the HSE on request, and summaries of the results should be provided to trade union and safety representatives (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, page 10). If there is a failure of correctly fitted RPE, an investigation must be conducted to determine the reason for the failure (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 15.pdf, page 10).

APs must identify all sources within their Area of Responsibility (AoR) that present a risk of inhalation of legionella bacteria and consider systems with water temperatures between 20–45 °C or water storage and recirculation as potential risks (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32, page 5). Common water systems that pose a potential risk include cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot and cold water services (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32, page 10). APs must make sure suitable and sufficient risk assessments of all such systems are conducted (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32, page 7). Once a risk assessment is completed, a Legionella Management Plan (LMP) should be put in place, maintained, and reviewed to ensure the control of legionella bacteria spread in water systems (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32, page 7). Regular consultation with all parties and competent personnel engagement are also essential for managing legionella risks effectively (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 32, pages 12-14).

0,,,,,,,What safety considerations do I need to make when building a trench?,"According to JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 33 (page 6), safety considerations when building a trench include evaluating all relevant information, such as previous usage of the site and what buried hazards may be expected. Hand digging should be done using spades and shovels instead of picks, pins, or forks to avoid damaging underground services. Existing standards set the minimum depth at which services should be buried, but experience has shown that this is not always the case. Additionally, when building a trench for a target area, a minimum length of 1.5m protection must be provided for each person taking cover (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 22, page 5). The design of the target should take account of the possibility of a grenade exploding outside the target area due to error by the grenadier, and there should be no netting or cam nets that could snag the throwing or posting arm (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 22, page 5).

If asbestos is suspected but not confirmed, an asbestos survey should be conducted to identify its presence, location, and condition (page 17). Commanders and managers must make sure that no activity involving asbestos or suspected asbestos is conducted unless a suitable and sufficient workplace risk assessment is completed, the required control measures to prevent exposure are implemented, and all persons involved have access to relevant safety information (Policy Statement 3, pages 7-8). If asbestos is found, it is important to stop work and prevent access to the area.

1. Suspect NFCI if the person is experiencing numbness, tingling, pain, or swelling in their hands or feet after prolonged exposure to cold or wet conditions.
2. Prevent further cooling by sheltering the casualty from wind and rain, providing insulation between them and the ground, and removing wet clothing.
3. Warm the affected part using available measures such as body warmth, clothing, rubbing, hand warmers, but avoid immersing it in water or holding it up to direct heat or flame.
4. Once warmed, re-check the hands and feet for any signs of NFCI and refer to the NFCI Field Assessment Tool (NFAT) for guidance.
5. If symptoms persist, make a working diagnosis of NFCI and recommend the appropriate JMES.
6. Record the episode on DMICP.
7. For severe cases or those with persistent symptoms, consider specialist referral to DMRC Headley Court, the NHS, or the Cold Injury Clinic (CIC).
8. Ensure adequate wind and water-proofing if still in the field, provide hot drinks and food, and refer to a medic for initial assessment and then onto a doctor.
9. Do not allow the casualty to return to the cold environment until they have fully recovered.
10. Train for buddy checks and hand and foot inspections using the NFCI Field Assessment Tool (NFAT).
11. Record the whole risk assessment for the activity using Mod Form 5010 or an alternative.
12. Make sure everyone taking part in the activity understands the risks, control measures, and medical plan.
13. If something has changed, carry out a dynamic risk assessment.

1. Gradually increase exposure and training time in the cold to give new entrants confidence and ability to recognize potential areas of risk early enough to employ countermeasures (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex C, p. 2).
2. Establish a buddy system and check on personnel under your command more frequently, especially those of African or Caribbean race (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex C, p. 2).
3. Avoid static training in locations that are particularly damp or wet, and reduce risk of cold injury by placing insulation inside fighting positions, sentry points, and observation points (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex C, p. 1).
4. Ensure adequate nutrition and avoid perspiration or wet extremities (JSP 539 Part 2, p. 12).
5. Provide guidance to personnel on adjusting physical training and clothing according to wind chill category and work intensity (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex C, p. 6).
6. Encourage regular meals and snacking and plan breaks to allow this (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex C, p. 6).
7. Make sure personnel are comfortable about reporting any potential problem and that there will be no negative consequences from reporting (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex C, p. 5).
8. Put a ‘buddy’ system in place to monitor performance and health and teach personnel to check their buddies every few hours (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex A, p. 10).
9. Supervise personnel at all times in cold conditions and make sure hand and foot inspections are carried out frequently (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 42 Annex A, p. 10).

Input from human factors specialists may also be required to ensure that the activities can be carried out safely and easily (JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7, page 6).

Additionally, all physical changes to the equipment, including software changes, modifications, and amendments to specifications, must be evaluated, risk assessed, approved, implemented, and documented (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 35, page 4).

The sand surface should be loose and covered by a layer of sand as specified in the relevant chapter for the range. Sand bullet catchers are ballistically suitable for all weapons but can cause dust and cleaning problems indoors. To prevent tunneling at the MPI behind targets, the sand in the bullet catcher needs to be raked regularly to keep the surface in a loose state and restore the profile to the slope stated in the relevant chapter (02113). The quality of the sand used should conform to BS EN 12620: 2002 description ""0/4 Concrete Sand"" and grading should conform to BSI PD 6682-1 Table D1, ""0/4 Concrete Sand CP"" with angular shape for slope stability and sound physical properties (02111). If the sand tends to break up on impact at close range causing debris smaller than the sand particles, the sand will remain stable as long as the lead particles and debris are small and well spread over the area behind the MPI (037).

The MOD is exempt from clause 79(1)(g) of the EPA 1990 regarding smoke and noise emitted from premises for operational and training activities so long as they are directly related to national security (JSP 418 Leaflet 4-1, p. 2; JSP 418 Leaflet 4, p. 2).

0,,,,,,,How do I manage the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates?,"To manage the risk of optimism bias affecting estimates, you can follow these steps as outlined in JSP 507 Part 2.pdf:

1. Start with an upper bound estimate for both works duration and capital expenditure.
2. Consider whether the optimism bias factor can be reduced based on the degree to which contributory factors are managed.
3. Apply the optimism bias factor to the cost estimate to get the expected value or ""mean"" estimate.
4. Compare the optimism bias adjusted estimate with the 90% estimate for works duration and the existing calculation of confidence figures using a bottom-up approach.
5. If the optimism bias adjusted figure is close to, or exceeds, the 90% cost estimate, this should not be ignored but rather treated as a sanity check of the risk assessment.
6. In medium and large sized projects, three point estimates of individual costs and risks will have been input, and the outputs will be expressed as levels of confidence. Optimism bias should be treated as an independent top-down sanity check in these cases.
7. For small projects or where the project is at an early stage of development, optimism bias should be applied as an explicit adjustment to the single point cost estimates in the investment appraisal in the absence of specific risk adjustments.
8. Sensitivity analysis should be used to test the potential impact of optimism on key parameters. (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, pages 109-113)

It is also important to note that optimism bias should only be applied to new expenditure and not to opportunity costs of existing assets.

0,,,,,,,How is financial compensation calculated for people made redundant from service?,"The financial compensation for people made redundant from service is calculated based on their final relevant earnings (FRE) and the length of their completed and uncompleted service. The specific calculation formula varies depending on the individual's circumstances, such as whether they have completed sufficient service to qualify for Early Discharge Pension (EDP), their rank, and the length of their uncompleted service commitment.

For example, if a person is made redundant before completing a short service commitment and has insufficient service to qualify for EDP, their compensation is calculated as shown at para 0315 in JSP 764 Part 5.pdf (page 14). If they have completed sufficient service to qualify for EDP but are under age 55 on leaving, para 0216 applies, and the CLS entitlement is the lesser of FRE/8 x completed years or (FRE/8 x uncompleted years) + FRE/8.

If a person's service ended after the EDP 18/40 Point and their uncompleted service is more than four years, the terms at para 0213 apply, and the CLS due is FRE x 1.

The calculation of compensation for people made redundant from a short service commitment may also involve determining the relevant period and potential repayment of compensation if the person's service break is shorter than the relevant period.

For more detailed examples and calculations, refer to the provided JSP 764 Part 5.pdf passages","['This passage is from JSP 764 Part 5.pdf, page 14: ""CALCULATION OF COMPENSATION - SHORT SERVICE COMMITMENTS 0314.

The DSAT process is governed and managed to ensure its proper implementation (JSP 822 Vol 1.pdf, p. 7). Well-designed training can still fail if not delivered effectively (JSP 822 Vol 3.pdf, p. 107). The Defence Training Assurance Framework provides a structured approach to assurance activities and focuses on the training system as a whole, including authorization of training, DSAT processes, and supporting elements of personnel and pipeline management (JSP 822 Vol 5.pdf, p. 5)","['This passage is from JSP 822 Vol 3.pdf, page 107: "". f.

For active members, the Tier 3 award is calculated by their length of service within AFPS 15 plus an enhancement, which is then multiplied by the average annual pension (paragraphs 54.2-54.3). If a member was both an active member and a pensioner member at the time of death, and the lump sum payable as a pensioner member is greater than four times their final pensionable earnings, then the amount payable upon death will be the larger of the two amounts (paragraph 79). For pensioner members, the pension payments are not recalculated once they start receiving a pension under AFPS 15 or reach the Deferred Pension Age for a member of that scheme (paragraph 147.2).
