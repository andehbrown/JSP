The installation can exist in one of three states: In Use, Temporarily decommissioned, or decommissioned. If the asset is no longer required on a permanent basis, it can be decommissioned by subjecting it to an engineering process that leaves it in a safe state without the need for further maintenance (JSP 317 Part 1, page 63). As part of the specific asset project activity, it needs to be decided whether the asset will be demolished in a short timeframe or decommissioned for the long-term and demolished at a later date (JSP 317 Part 1, page 63). Once an asset is decommissioned, it will ultimately require full demolition at some point (JSP 317 Part 2, page 276). The authorization to proceed with changing the bulk fuel storage infrastructure asset from an operational state to any one of the other three options, including decommissioning, can only be provided by the relevant TLB after comprehensive planning and execution processes have been undertaken and a detailed project plan produced within a 12-month period (JSP 317 Part 1, page 64).

COSHH Essentials follows a step by step process resulting in a recommended control approach. Supporting this are Control Guidance Sheets that the HSE have produced. Whilst it is not expected that these approaches will apply in all cases, the principles should be used with suitable adjustments to enable appropriate controls to be implemented""  '

PLAN - identify problems and opportunities 1. Like any health and safety assessment, a COSHH assessment should begin with a thorough walk-around observation of all areas and processes in the workplace, including waste storage and disposal systems (the COSHH Assessment Process Flowchart is at Annex A of this chapter). 2. The requirement following substances directly identified, is to design and operate processes and activities to minimise emission, release and spread of substances hazardous to health, by considering the following: a. consider ways to achieve and maintain control of exposures where prevention is not deemed practicable (decisions should be recorded), e.g. ventilation systems, containment, substituting materials; b""  '

However, if such controls are not practicable given the working environment or where adequate control of exposure cannot be achieved by other means or if there is a temporary failure of control measures, then PPE or RPE will need to be used. The use of PPE or RPE will often be required for maintenance operations for which the risk of exposure must be COSHH assessed. 11. The assessment should consider activities and processes and should NOT just be substance specific. Whilst substance specific assessment may appear an easier way of doing the assessment it does not enable consideration of the interfaces and additive effects where more than one substance is used in a task. 12. Therefore, the assessment should: a. fully identify the activity or process; b. identify all substances or products being used or produced; c. consider who and how many are likely to be exposed, how and for how long;""  '

The completed assessment should be recorded using MOD Form 5011 and passed to the commander, line manager or project leader for implementation of the control measures and inclusion on the establishment / unit / platform COSHH Master Register (MOD Form 5011a). 23.

A WBGT reading is the best way of factoring environmental conditions into a risk assessment, as it takes account of temperature, humidity, wind speed and sunlight. The WBGT is a combined measure of the dry-bulb temperature (the air temperature), wet-bulb temperature (the temperature the air can be cooled to through the effect of evaporation) and globe temperature (a temperature reading that takes account of the effect of sunlight, air temperature and wind speed). It is measured in degrees Celsius. You can use the QT34 monitor to check the difference between the dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature. When the two numbers are close, the humidity is high and the risk of heat illness is increased. This is because the higher humidity prevents sweat from evaporating.

1. Identify critical safety controls, instrumentation, and systems required for safe operation during the concept and design stages. Determine the proposed operating envelope for the equipment and evaluate any potential commission, life extension, or uses outside of the planned scope (JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7, page 5).
2. Consider whether a safety case is proportionate given the complexity of the equipment and the level of risk involved. If necessary, develop a safety case that captures all safety-related risks associated with the equipment and demonstrates how these risks will be managed to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level (JSP 375 Vol 1 Ch 35, page 6).
3. Ensure the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) or User is responsible for making sure that a safety case has been produced and all relevant safety issues have been considered (JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7, page 6).
4. Update the safety case to match the configuration of the equipment and when there is a material change to the understanding, risk profile, design, or operation of the equipment (JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7, page 6).
5. Involve stakeholders and human factors specialists for validation and input on assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other Defence Lines of Development (DLODs) and ensuring activities can be carried out safely and easily (JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7, page 6).

Planning in advance the safety argument that the SRO hopes to be able to make when a system is delivered and used in service should inform the safety requirements for the equipment, and the type of activities that will be necessary in the acquisition programme and during operation to generate the evidence to support the safety case. This information should in turn support decisions such as the choice of supplier and whether to use a bespoke, off-the-shelf or customised design. 17""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 815 Vol 2 Elm 7.pdf, page 6: "". 17. Safety cases for equipment should be forward-looking and take into account activities beyond normal operation and training. They must also consider how equipment can be manufactured, tested, commissioned, transported, stored, maintained and disposed of safely. Stakeholder input will be required to validate assumptions made by the safety case about the contribution of other DLODs. Input from human factors specialists is also likely to be required to ensure these activities can be carried out safely and easily. Risk controls that cannot be put into practice easily are unlikely to be effective. 18. Safety cases should be updated to match the configuration of the equipment and when there is a ‘material change’ to the understanding, risk profile, design or operation of the equipment""  '

Where a risk assessment is not sufficient to demonstrate that the risks to the equipment have been adequately identified, communicated and/or controlled, then a safety case must be developed. A safety case is used to provide compelling evidence that equipment is safe for a given application in a given operating environment. A safety case must capture all the safety related risks associated with that equipment and evidence how these risks will be managed to as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and to a tolerable level. 15. The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) or the User, is responsible for making sure that a safety case has been produced and that all relevant safety issues have been considered.

During concept and design stages and within the safety case, the proposed operating envelope for the equipment should be determined.

Under Section 1 of the NIA, ONR licenses operators of nuclear facilities.    Relevant subsidiary legislation, from which the MOD is not exempt, comprises the 2017 Ionising Radiation Regulations (IRR17), and the 2019 Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations  (REPPIR19).

2. Sand in the bullet catcher should be raked to prevent tunneling and keep the surface loose (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 2, p. 36).
3. The sand is important for identifying the fall of shot and simplifying de-leading (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15, p. 6).
4. An area behind the target is excavated to a depth of 500 mm and filled with coarse sand as specified in Chapter 2 (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 15, p. 6).

Over time bullets pounding the sand reduce it to fine dust behind the MPI, at this point the sand will need to be replaced. 02112. Construction. The core of the bullet catcher or stop butt may be constructed of any stable inert fill material. However, the surface is to be covered by sand as specified in the relevant Chapter for the range.

The stop butt is the area extending above and to the sides of the bullet catcher and should be subjected to lesser concentrations of fire. Its purpose is to stop direct shot in free flight within maximum predicted aimer deviation margins and ricochet from the predicted first point of impact.

When large quantities of 7.62 mm rounds are fired or there are excessive quantities of jacket and bullet debris, balls of lead and other hazardous debris build up in the sand. The bullets tend to remain intact after impacting into the sand and can fuse together into a ball, which often occurs below the surface of the sand at the MPI behind the target after about 20,000 rounds have been fired in a lane. When subsequent bullets striking the ball no longer drive it deeper into the sand, backsplash and ricochet become hazards.

For targets located 150m or more from the firing point, a prepared area where all soft earth, reed, and tall grass has been removed is sufficient (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 28, p. 2810). Imported stone or gravel with no large stones behind which blinds may lodge should be used in peaty areas as an initiation surface (ibid.). Additionally, initiating stop butts may be constructed to capture rounds that miss the target (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 28, p. 2811).

Furthermore, the impact area surface should be levelled and kept free of debris, and grass and vegetation in the RDA (Ready Area) extending at least 20m around the impact area should be kept short to enable RCOs (Range Control Officers) to locate and clear any blinds landing wide of the prepared impact area (JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 22, p. 4).

However, to determine the loudness of the 81mm mortar in decibels at a certain distance, we would need additional information such as the attenuation due to various factors like ground absorption, wind and turbulence, temperature, and relative humidity. The reference text does provide this information for the SLR (Self-Loading Rifle) but not for the 81mm mortar. Therefore, an exact answer to this question cannot be determined from the provided reference text alone.

However, we do know that without a noise reduction system in place, the sound levels produced by an 81mm mortar would be significant. The passage on page 5 of JSP 403 Vol 2 Ch 31.pdf states that the total attenuation for sounds in the 300-600 Hz octave (which is relevant for small arms and therefore not important for an 81mm mortar) is 107.5 dB without a bank, indicating that even without considering the sound produced by the mortar itself, significant attenuation would be required to reduce the sound levels to acceptable levels.

Therefore, while we cannot provide an exact decibel level for the loudness of an 81mm mortar based on the provided reference text alone, it is clear that the sound produced by this weapon would be very loud and require significant noise reduction measures to mitigate its impact on nearby areas.

First, adjusting for optimism should provide a better estimate earlier on in the project (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, p. 104). Second, it is important to review both the original risk assessment and the optimism bias adjustment, document the outcome, and compare the optimism bias adjusted figure to the 90% cost estimate (JSP 507 Part 2.pdfs, p. 110). Third, if there is no other evidence to support adjustments to operating costs or benefits, sensitivity analysis should be used to check switching values (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, p. 105). Fourth, optimism bias should still be considered for key project parameters such as works duration and capital expenditure (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, p. 105). Fifth, adjusting for optimism bias is an ongoing process that should be assessed at each key stage in a project's approval process (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, p. 109). Finally, recommended adjustment ranges for generic project categories can be found in Table 1 of the reference text (JSP 507 Part 2.pdf, p. 108-109).

Additionally, if a reservist has previously left the Armed Forces with an Immediate Pension (IP) under AFPS 75 and dies in service, they would receive a lump sum of four times their pensionable earnings less the IP lump sum (JSP 764 Part 3.pdf, page 8).

OPCOM is the authority granted to a commander to assign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units, and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical control as necessary. It allows a commander to assign separate employment to components of the units concerned but does not include responsibility for administration or logistics (Annex A.pdf, pages 4-5). On the other hand, Tactical Command (TACOM) is the authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority. It involves detailed local direction and control of movement or maneuver necessary to accomplish missions or assigned tasks but does not include the authority to assign separate employment of components of the units concerned or administrative or logistic control (Annex A.pdf, page 5). Therefore, OPCOM is a broader command authority that includes the ability to assign missions and tasks and delegate operational and tactical control, while TACOM is a more specific command authority focused on assigning tasks for the accomplishment of a mission and providing detailed local direction and control.

These drugs include anabolic agents such as anabolic steroids, pro-hormones, peptide hormones and growth factors such as Erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, corticotrophins, and growth hormone. It is therefore important to distinguish between dietary supplements and drugs. 3. Dietary Supplements. Dietary supplements contribute to the nutritional needs of the body by providing significant amounts of carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, or trace elements, in a form that is readily used by the body. Fish oils, Creatine Monohydrate, carbohydrate drinks and protein shakes all fall into this category""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 835.pdf, page 40: "". Such products may not be generally needed in a normal military life style, but the taking of such dietary supplements is highly unlikely to lead to a positive CDT if they are responsibly sourced and used as directed. 4. Drugs. Drugs do not contribute significantly to the nutritional needs of the body and are consumed in microgram (μg) doses. Drugs exert a profound effect on the body and are able to produce significant gains in performance. EPO, anabolic steroids and growth 1 Boos CJ., Wheble GA., Campbell MJ., Tabner KC. and Woods DR.

Recent studies1 suggest the use of supplements by members of the UK Armed Forces is widespread, and includes trainees, UK-based troops and those preparing to deploy, as well as personnel in operational theatres. Whilst the use of some supplements in certain circumstances can have positive effects, their misuse can have detrimental effects on the health of individuals and could lead to a positive Compulsory Drug Test (CDT) outcome. What are supplements? 2. The term supplement is used to describe a wide range of products ingested by individuals who desire a range of physiological and/or psychological effects from the provision of additional nutrients from the supplement. These nutrients may be absent from the normal daily diet, or may not be consumed in sufficient amounts to achieve ergogenic (performance enhancing) effects""  '
 'This passage is from JSP 835.pdf, page 41: "". In general, short-term energy restriction involving minimal loss of body mass has little effect on performance or health in otherwise healthy individuals. Losses of body mass in the region of 6 – 10% or higher have been shown to impair performance in a military setting, although this is not a consistent observation. 9. Dietary supplements should not be used to compensate for poor food choices and an inadequate diet where a choice exists, but dietary supplements that provide additional energy and / or essential nutrients may be useful when food intake or food choices are restricted for reasons including operational constraints, travel, and periods when preparation and / or consumption of adequate meals is not possible or desirable. The use of dietary supplements in such instances would reduce the risk of developing nutrient deficiencies that could impair both health and performance. 2 HFL Sport Science is an independent drug surveillance laboratory owned by LGC.""

While current advice from the Defence Nutrition Advisory Service (DNAS) is that it is not necessary for any members of the UK military to take dietary supplements as the necessary energy and nutrient intake can be obtained from eating a regular and balanced diet, supporting guidance on the use of dietary supplements is being prepared for Service personnel who wish to consume them. 3 IOC Consensus Statement on Sports Nutrition, Lausanne Oct 2010.""

Suitable professionals include registered nutritionists, registered dieticians, and other professionals with recognised expertise in performance-related nutrition. Service personnel contemplating the use of dietary supplements should consider their efficacy, their cost, the risk to health and performance, and the potential for a positive CDT. The use of multiple dietary supplements at one time (stacking) should be discouraged. Dietary supplement use by children (i.e. individuals under 18 years of age) should also be discouraged.

However, there is no explicit mention of specific human factors integration responsibilities in this passage.

The passages from JSP 912 Part 1.pdf emphasize the importance of Human Factors Integration (HFI) for capability development and the need to engage HFI teams early and throughout the programme. Based on these passages, it can be inferred that a Capability Sponsor's role may include ensuring that human factors integration is adequately addressed during the development of new capabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided reference text, a Capability Sponsor's responsibilities for human factors integration could include:

1. Ensuring that human factors integration is considered and addressed throughout the capability development process.
2. Leading the Capability Change Planning Process with an understanding of the importance of HFI in delivering successful capabilities.
3. Engaging HFI teams early and throughout the programme to ensure adequate consideration of the Human Component of Capability.
4. Ensuring that system interoperability and compatibility requirements align to costed user requirements, which may include human factors considerations.

This involves effectively integrating people and equipment through operational, organizational, and management processes (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 9). Human-Centered Design is an approach that accommodates human needs within the design of technological products/systems (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 9). Additionally, identifying risks and concerns associated with the design, necessary risk mitigation activities, modifications to ensure the item is fit for purpose in its military context, and applying Human Factors analyses during the design and development process are essential steps (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48). The duty to ensure that Off-The-Shelf Equipment can be operated safely and effectively in a range of environments and against a range of threats also applies (JSP 912 Part 2, p. 48).

Failure to consider the Human Component of Capability can have many adverse consequences: increased risk of accidents and incidents; higher training costs; reduced performance and mission effectiveness; breaches in duty of care; scarcity of appropriately skilled personnel; delays to the project schedule and substantial increases in design / redesign costs. 8. To achieve the required capability, both of these components must work in close combination and harmony. The effectiveness and efficiency of the resulting system, or a constituent part, may depend critically on the Human Component and the adequacy of this combination. Of critical importance is that the People and Equipment Components must be effectively integrated together. 9.

It derives its authority from the MOD Permanent KTRaTcPahjb Letter of Delegation to the Defence Authority for Technical & Quality Assurance and the associated Defence Authority Directive (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 5, 1.5). The policy aims to ensure the correct standards are maintained by promoting Governance, Assurance, and Improvement of acquisition, engineering, and logistics support activities through consistent management of Quality across defence (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 5, 1.2). It also requires the avoidance of counterfeit materiel in Section 1.4 (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 6). The MOD Quality Policy is a key element of Governance, Assurance, and Improvement, which provides maintenance and control of the business to raise performance at all levels of the organisation (JSP 940 Part 1.pdf, page 5, 1.3).

0,,,,,,,How does damage control surgery differ from in-theatre surgery?,"Damage control surgery (DCS) and in-theatre surgery are two different surgical approaches used in military medical settings, as described in the provided reference text. DCS is focused on halting deterioration of a patient's physiological condition rather than attempting definitive restoration of function, and it aims to rapidly control haemorrhage while maintaining perfusion of essential tissues and organs (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 28). It is typically used when the physiological derangement is severe and the patient would not likely survive prolonged surgery (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13). DCS may require critical care support at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) or an alternative MTF accessible by Critical Care Air Support Team level TACEVAC within an appropriate timeline (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13).

In contrast, in-theatre surgery is a delayed surgical intervention that occurs after the patient's physiological and other relevant parameters have been restored to as close to normal as possible (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13). It usually requires a combination of general and orthopaedic surgery and may include burns & plastic surgery wherever possible (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13). In-theatre surgery can only occur within a DHC unit and may consist of several surgical procedures spread over a period of time and may require the movement of patients between MTFs within a theatre of operations (JSP 950 Leaflet 1-4-1, p. 13).

Therefore, damage control surgery is an emergency intervention aimed at stabilizing the patient and preventing further deterioration, while in-theatre surgery is a delayed surgical intervention aimed at restoring function and definitively treating injuries.

This includes internal training designed and delivered in line with JSP 822, Defence Direction and Guidance for Training and Education, as well as specialist training such as the Human Security in Defence Course (Defence TRAD) for individuals working in roles at operational and strategic levels that require human security integration or delivery. The lead TRA for UK Defence level requirements is Strategic Command HQ, while sS leads for Service level training. They must ensure that human security is included in command and leadership training and provide relevant training for deployed personnel based on the region and context to which they are deploying.

Human Security is an approach to national and international security which places the emphasis on human beings, rather than the traditional focus on the security of the state. Moving the security agenda beyond state security does not mean replacing it; rather, it complements and builds on it. It is applicable to situations above and below the threshold of armed conflict, across all domains and surpasses geographical boundaries. This pervasiveness of Human Security means that it is vital that it is considered across the spectrum of UK Defence. UK Defence’s Human Security approach is governed by international and domestic law and is underpinned by United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), NATO policies and the National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security.

It explains why and how UK Defence must incorporate Human Security considerations in all that it does, from strategic planning through to the activity performed at the operational and tactical levels. In doing this, we will be able to better plan conflict sensitive outcomes by understanding the impacts on the human environment, minimising harm to civilians and reducing Human Rights’ violations, ultimately improving the conditions for stability. This policy reinforces the direction of the Integrated Operating Concept and recognises that the implementation of Human Security requires a whole of government approach, with military objectives integrated within a broader cross government strategy. By coordinating with other actors, we can shape the discourse on the security of human beings on the global stage and increase the prospects for long term peace and stability""  '
